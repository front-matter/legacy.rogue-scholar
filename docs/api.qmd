The [Rogue Scholar API](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/rest_api_index/) is provided by the InvenioRDM application. A customized version of the API documentation for Rogue Scholar is in the works. 

The previous version of the API is still available at [https://api.rogue-scholar.org/docs](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/docs) with a SwaggerUI interface, but will be retired in 2025.
