For some years now, our last line of defence has been a reliable, tried-and-tested technology. One that&rsquo;s been around for a while. Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about the humble <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk#8-inch_and_5%C2%BC-inch_disks\" target=\"_blank\">5¼ inch floppy disk</a>.</p>\n<p>This may come as surprise to some. When things go well, you&rsquo;re probably never aware of them. In day to day use, the only time a typical Crossref user sees a floppy disk is when they click &lsquo;save&rsquo; (yes, some journals still require submissions in Microsoft Word).</p>\n<h2 id=\"history\">History</h2>\n<p>But why?</p>\n<p>Let me take you back to the early days of Crossref. The technology scene was different. This data was too important to trust to new and unproven technologies like Zip disks, CD-Rs or USB Thumb Drives. So we started with punched cards.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/2023-04-01-renewed-persistence/punched-card.jpg\"\nalt=\"IBM 5081-style punched card.\" width=\"100%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>IBM 5081-style punched card.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Punched cards are reliable and durable as long as you don&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card#Do_Not_Fold,_Spindle_or_Mutilate\" target=\"_blank\">fold, spindle or mutilate</a> them. But even in 2001 we knew that punched cards&rsquo; days were numbered. The capacity of 80 characters kept DOIs short. Translating DOIs into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC\" target=\"_blank\">EBCDIC</a> made <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII\" target=\"_blank\">ASCII</a> a challenge, let alone <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Item_and_Contribution_Identifier\" target=\"_blank\">SICI</a>s. We kept a close eye on the nascent Unicode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"breathing-room\">Breathing Room</h2>\n<p>In 2017 the change of DOI display guidelines from <code>http://dx.doi.org</code> to <code>https://doi.org</code> shortened each DOI by 2 characters, buying us some time. But eventually we knew we had to upgrade to something more modern.</p>\n<p>So we migrated to 5¼ inch floppy disks.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/2023-04-01-renewed-persistence/floppy-in-drive.jpg\"\nalt=\"5¼ Floppy disk in drive\" width=\"100%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>5¼ Floppy disk in drive</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>At 640 KB per disk these were a huge improvement. We could fit around 20,000 DOIs on one floppy. Today we only need around 10,000 floppy disks to store all of our DOIs (not the metadata, just the DOIs). Surprisingly this only takes about 20 metres of shelf space to store.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/2023-04-01-renewed-persistence/desktop.jpg\"\nalt=\"laptop computer connected to floppy disk drive, pile of disks next to it\" width=\"100%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Typical work from home setup.

DOIs registration shows no sign of slowing down. It&rsquo;s clear we need a new, compact storage medium.

Crossref makes it easy for our members to submit data citations to support the scholarly record.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h3>\n<p>Citations are essential/core metadata that all members should submit for all articles, conference proceedings, preprints, and books. Submitting data citations to Crossref has long been possible. And it’s easy, you just need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include data citations in the references section <strong>as you would for any other citation</strong></li>\n<li>Include a DOI or other persistent identifier for the data if it is available - just <strong>as you would for any other citation</strong></li>\n<li>Submit the references to Crossref through the content registration process <strong>as you would for any other record</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And your data citations will flow through all the normal processes that Crossref applies to citations. And it will be distributed openly to the community (including DataCite!) via Crossref’s services and APIs. All data citations deposited with Crossref will be exposed in the (soon-to-be launched) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5438/vjz9-kx84\" target=\"_blank\">Data Citation Corpus</a>.</p>\n<p>And then, you can sit back and congratulate yourself for making your publication more useful to researchers who want to be able to reuse the data underlying your publications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n<p>You might ask, “So if submitting Data Citations to Crossref has long been possible, why do you have to write this?”</p>\n<p>Historically, authors did not cite data in the way they cited publications. Instead, they would often refer to the data in the main text of the article. This has made it hard to determine what data lay behind the research and/or access the data.</p>\n<p>But the research community has increasingly recognized that data is a first-class research output and that we should treat it as such. In short, we should formally cite data.</p>\n<p>But because citing data is a comparatively new practice, it has been subject to a lot of new analysis. And unsurprisingly, people analyzing data citation have discovered that there is a lot of nuance to citation <em>of any kind</em>.</p>\n<p>There are lots of reasons for citing something. There are lots of internalized conventions for citing things. And there are different conventions for citation for different research objects. And SSH citation practice differs from STEM. And legal citation practices are different from scholarly citation practices. And citation practices even vary by subdiscipline and by journal.</p>\n<p>Those who have been looking at what it means to “cite data” have naturally stumbled into a thicket of divergent practices - some of which are historical holdovers, some of which are stylistic preferences, and some of which are clearly adaptations to deal with the specific needs of certain research objects/containers or different disciplines.</p>\n<p>The temptation has been to try and rationalize this <em>before</em> extending the practice of citation to data.</p>\n<p>“Maybe because data is a distinct content type, we should include the fact that it is a data citation in the citation itself?”</p>\n<p>“Maybe because people cite data for different reasons, we should include a typology of citation types in all data citations?”</p>\n<p>And so you may hear some people say, “hold off on data citation - we don’t have an optimal way to do it yet, and it can be very complicated.”</p>\n<p>But guess what?</p>\n<p>We currently don’t label citations to monographs as “citation to monograph.”</p>\n<p>And we don’t currently include the reason for citation when we are citing a journal article.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sparontologies.github.io/cito/current/cito.html\" target=\"_blank\">It would be very cool if we did.</a> And it would likely make citations even more useful if we did.</p>\n<p>But citations are already useful even without these features. And so, to delay citing data indefinitely because we have an opportunity to improve the act of citation is just perverse. Our community has always opted for progress over perfection.</p>\n<p>For one thing - the efforts are not mutually exclusive. We can start citing data with the current limitations of citation practices and simultaneously propose mechanisms for making citation more useful in the future, including new guidelines to deal with the unique issues that citing data poses.</p>\n<p>But in the meantime, we will be doing researchers a giant favour if we at least include our imperfect and ambiguous, and unconventional references to data in the references section of an article so that they can be accessed and processed along with all the other imperfect, ambiguous and variant citations that we find so useful.</p>\n<p>Some of our members are already doing this. They have been for a long time. And they haven’t found it any more complicated than managing non-data references in the past.</p>\n<p>Join them and make your metadata more useful.</p>\n<p>Cite data now. Don’t put it off.</p>\n<p>And Crossref will continue to work with DataCite and the rest of the community to make the distribution even easier and more useful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-who-is-already-citing-data\">So who is already citing data?</h3>\n<h4 id=\"top-10-members-depositing-data-citations-from-november-may-2022\">Top 10 members depositing data citations from November-May 2022</h4>\n<p>(broken down by DOI prefix, which is why you see some publishers listed twice):</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prefix</strong>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Member name</strong>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Data citations deposited</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.1038\n</td>\n<td>Springer Science and Business Media LLC\n</td>\n<td>7174\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.1016\n</td>\n<td>Elsevier BV\n</td>\n<td>6527\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.1007\n</td>\n<td>Springer Science and Business Media LLC\n</td>\n<td>4748\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.5194\n</td>\n<td>Copernicus GmbH\n</td>\n<td>3017\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.1080\n</td>\n<td>Informa UK Limited\n</td>\n<td>2346\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.1177\n</td>\n<td>SAGE Publications\n</td>\n<td>2082\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.1002\n</td>\n<td>Wiley\n</td>\n<td>2048\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.1111\n</td>\n<td>Wiley\n</td>\n<td>1888\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.1108\n</td>\n<td>Emerald\n</td>\n<td>1876\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.3390\n</td>\n<td>MDPI AG\n</td>\n<td>1827\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h4 id=\"top-10-data-citations-per-deposited-work\">Top 10 data citations per deposited work</h4>\n<p>(again, broken down by prefix)</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Member name</strong>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Prefix</strong>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Data citations deposited</strong>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Data citations per work</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Consortium Erudit\n</td>\n<td>10.7202\n</td>\n<td>580\n</td>\n<td>1.149\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SLACK, Inc.\n</td>\n<td>10.3928\n</td>\n<td>462\n</td>\n<td>0.646\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S.

Here, Deborah Plavin and David Haber share the story of ASM’s success and lessons learnt along the way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"could-you-introduce-your-organization\">Could you introduce your organization?</h3>\n<p>The American Society for Microbiology publishes 16 peer-reviewed journals advancing the microbial sciences, from food microbiology, to genomics and the microbiome, comprising 14% of all microbiology articles. Six of those are open-access journals, and 56% of ASM’s published papers are open access. Together, our journals contribute 25% of all microbiology citations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"would-you-tell-us-a-little-more-about-yourselves\">Would you tell us a little more about yourselves?</h3>\n<p>DH: David Haber, Publishing Operations Director at the American Society for Microbiology. I live in a century-old house that is in a perpetual state of renovation due to my inability to stop starting new projects before I complete old ones.</p>\n<p>DP: Deborah Plavin, Digital Publishing Manager at the American Society for Microbiology. Following David’s example, my apartment in Washington D.C. is just up the block from one of the homes Duke Ellington lived in <a href=\"https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=142334\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=142334</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-value-do-society-publishers-in-general-see-in-metadata-in-your-view\">What value do society publishers in general see in metadata in your view?</h3>\n<p>DP: In my view, robust metadata allows publishers to look at changes over time, do comparative analysis within and across research areas, more easily identify trends, and plan for future analysis (e.g., if we deposit data citation information and we change our processes to make it more straightforward, do we see any change in the percentage of articles that include that information, etc.).</p>\n<p>DH: To echo Deborah&rsquo;s point, to be able to name something distinctly and clearly identify its specific attributes is vital to understanding past research and planning for future possibilities. One of our fundamental roles as a publisher for a non-profit society is to properly lay this metadata foundation so that we can provide services and new venues for our members, authors, and readers that match their needs and track with the trends in research. Without good and robust metadata, it is impossible to truly understand the direction in which our community is pointing us.</p>\n<h3 id=\"metadata-for-your-own-published-content-in-the-last-year-has-grown-rapidly-why-such-focus-on-metadata-in-2022\">Metadata for your own published content in the last year has grown rapidly. Why such focus on metadata in 2022?</h3>\n<p>DP: This is something that ASM has been chipping away at over time. Years ago we found that it wasn’t always easy to take advantage of deposits that included new kinds of metadata. That was either because we needed to work out how and where to capture it in the process or because platform providers weren’t always ready — coming up with ways to process the XML that publishers supply in many different ways takes time. These back-end processes that feed the infrastructure aren’t usually of great interest to stakeholders, and so it allowed us to play around, flounder, fail, refine, and try again.</p>\n<p>We looked at having 3rd parties deposit metadata for us, and while that helped expand the kind of metadata we were delivering, it created workflow challenges of its own. What turned out to be most effective was budgeting for content cleanup projects and depositing updated and more robust metadata to Crossref.</p>\n<p>We also benefited from a platform migration, which allowed us to take advantage of additional resources during that process.</p>\n<p>DH: Coming from a production background, I have always been fascinated with the when and how of capturing key metadata during the publishing process. When are those data good and valuable, and when should they be tossed or cleaned up for downstream deliveries? Because Deborah and ASM directors saw a more complete Crossref metadata set for our corpus as a truly valuable target, we were able to really think hard about what kind of data we were capturing and when, how those requirements may have influenced our various policies and copyediting requirements over the years, and how best to re-engineer our processes with the goal of good metadata capture throughout our publishing workflows. From our perspective, Crossref gave us a target, a “this-is-cool-bit-of-info&quot; that Crossref can collect in a deposit; therefore, how can we capture that during our processes while driving further efficiencies? ASM journals had been so driven by legacy print workflows that such a change in perspective (toward metadata as a publishing object) really allowed us to re-imagine almost everything we do as a publisher.</p>\n<h3 id=\"has-the-ostp-memo-influenced-your-effort\">Has the OSTP memo influenced your effort?</h3>\n<p>DP: I think that the Nelson memo hasn’t changed our focus; instead, I think it’s been another data point supporting our efforts and work in this area.</p>\n<p>DH: Deborah is exactly right. The release of this memo only re-affirmed our commitment to creating complete and rich metadata. The Nelson memo points to many possible paths forward, in terms of both Open Access and Open Science, but we feel our work on improving our metadata outputs positions us well to pick a path that best suits our goals as a non-profit society publisher.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-big-was-this-effort-could-you-draw-us-a-picture-of-how-many-colleagues-or-parts-of-the-organization-were-involved-did-you-involve-any-external-stakeholders-such-as-authors-editors-or-others\">How big was this effort? Could you draw us a picture of how many colleagues or parts of the organization were involved? Did you involve any external stakeholders, such as authors, editors, or others?</h3>\n<p>DH: It was simple. Took five minutes…\nIn all seriousness, the key is having the support of the organization as a whole. To do this properly, it is vitally important to know the end from the beginning, so to speak. It is one thing to say let’s start capturing ORCID IDs and deliver them to Crossref, but it is completely another to create a cohesive process in which those IDs are authenticated and validated throughout the workflow. So something as simple as a statement “ORCID IDs seem cool, let’s try to capture them” could affect how researchers submit files, how reviewers log into various systems (i.e., ORCID as SSO), how data are passed to production vendors, what copyeditors and XML QC people need to be focused on, and what integrations authors may expect at the time of publication. Being part of an organization that embraced such change allowed us to proceed with care with each improvement to the metadata we made.</p>\n<p>But that is more about incremental improvement. The beginning of this process started when we were making upgrades to our online publishing platform, and we were trying to figure out how best to get DOIs registered for our older content. When we started looking at this, we soon realized that, sure, we could do the bare minimum and just assign DOIs to this older content outside the source XML/SGML, but did that make sense? Wouldn’t it make more sense, especially since we were updating the corpus to a new DTD, to populate the source content with these newly assigned DOIs? Once we decided that we were going to revise the older content with DOIs, it made sense for us to create a custom XSL transform routine to generate Crossref deposits that would capture as much metadata as possible. So, working with a vendor to clean and update our content for one project (an online platform update) allowed us also to make massive improvements to our Crossref metadata as a side benefit.</p>\n<p>Of course, I do have to apologize to the STM community for the Crossref outages in late 2019. That was just me depositing thousands of records in batches one sleepless night.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-were-the-key-challenges-you-encountered-in-this-project-and-how-did-you-overcome-them\">What were the key challenges you encountered in this project, and how did you overcome them?</h3>\n<p>DH: Resources and time are always an issue. Much of the work was done in-house in spare moments captured here and there. But there are great resources in github and at Crossref to help focus on defining what is important and what is possible in such a project. And, honestly, defining what was important and weighing that against the effort to find said important bit in the corpus of articles we have was the most challenging part of this process. In other words, limiting the focus. Once one decides to start looking at the inconsistencies in older content, it is hard not to say: “Oh, look. That semi-important footnote was treated as a generic author note rather than a conflict-of-interest statement; let’s fix that.” Once you start down that path, you can spend years fiddling with stuff. For me, a key mantra was: “We now have access to the content. We can always do another Crossref metadata update if things change or shift over time.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"have-there-been-any-important-milestones-along-the-way-you-were-able-to-celebrate-or-any-set-backs-you-had-to-resolve-in-the-process\">Have there been any important milestones along the way you were able to celebrate? Or any set-backs you had to resolve in the process?</h3>\n<p>DP: For as long as I can remember, the importance of good metadata has been among the loudest messages of best practice in the industry. I don’t think that I have been able to really quantify/ demonstrate the value of that work. Looking at the consistent increases in the Crossref monthly resolution reports that we saw between 2015 and 2022 and looking at our participation reports has helped provide some measure of progress. For example, the number of average monthly successful resolutions in that Crossref report in 2015 was ~390,000. The last time I checked, the 2022 numbers were ~ 3.7 million. In 2023, I hope that we will be able to leverage Event Data for this as well.</p>\n<p>The setbacks have fallen into two categories: timing and process. Our internal resourcing to get this done within our preferred time frame, to have the content loaded and delivered, and triage problems—it’s a battle between the calendar and competing priorities.</p>\n<p>DH: When Deborah first shared those stats with me, I was floored. I don’t think either of us suspected such an increase was possible. For me, the biggest setback was mistakenly sending about ~50,000 DOI records to queue and watching them all fail because I grabbed the wrong batch. Ooops. I never made that mistake again, though.</p>\n<h3 id=\"was-any-specific-type-of-metadata-or-any-part-of-the-schema-particularly-easy-or-particularly-difficult-to-get-right-in-asms-production-process\">Was any specific type of metadata or any part of the schema particularly easy or particularly difficult to get right in ASM’s production process?</h3>\n<p>DH: For us, the most difficult piece of metadata revolves around data availability and how we capture linked data resources (outside of data citation resources). Because of our current editorial style (which had been print-centric for years), we did not do a good job of identifying whether there are data associated with published content in a consistent machine-readable way. We did some experiments with one of our journals to capture this outside of our normal Crossref deposit routine, but that was not as accurate or sustainable as we would have liked. But, in that experiment, we learned a few things about how we treat these data throughout our publishing process and we have plans to create a sustainable integrated workflow for this to capture resource/data linkages in our Crossref deposits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-were-your-thoughts-on-last-years-move-to-open-references-metadata-has-that-impacted-on-your-project-in-any-way\">What were your thoughts on last year’s move to open references metadata? Has that impacted on your project in any way?</h3>\n<p>DP: We were really excited about this; based on the rather limited approach to sorting out impact at the moment, the more metadata we push out into the ecosystem, the more it appears to be used. In my view, that is at the core of what society publishers want to do—ensure that research is accessible and discoverable wherever our users expect to find it.</p>\n<p>DH: 100% agree.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-did-you-keep-motivated-and-on-course-throughout\">How did you keep motivated and on-course throughout?</h3>\n<p>DP: These kinds of things are never done; for example, we have placeholders for CRediT roles, and getting ready for that work as part of a DTD migration will be the next big thing. The motivation for that is really meeting our commitment to the community, seeing the impact of the author metadata versus article metadata, and seeing what we can learn.</p>\n<p>DH: Metadata at its core is one of the pillars of our service as a publisher. To provide the best service, we need to provide the best metadata possible. Just remembering that this can be incremental, allows us to celebrate the large moments and the small. And whether one is partying with a massive 7 layer cake or a smaller cake pop, both are sweet and motivating.</p>\n<h3 id=\"now-that-the-project-is-completed-are-you-seeing-the-benefits-you-were-hoping-to-achieve\">Now that the project is completed, are you seeing the benefits you were hoping to achieve?</h3>\n<p>DP: This is a hard one to answer as we are using limited measurements at this time. At a high level, I am pleased. While I am eager to leverage event data in the coming year, it would be really helpful to get feedback from the community on how we can improve as well as other ways to evaluate impact.</p>\n<p>DH: I want to take up this idea of metadata as a service once more. I don’t mean in terms of discoverability or searchability, either. Let’s take ORCID deposited into Crossref as an example. When done properly (with the proper authentication and validation occurring in the background), we are able to integrate citation data directly to an author&rsquo;s ORCID profile. We have found that this small service is really appreciated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-there-any-metadata-that-youd-like-to-be-able-to-include-with-your-publishing-records-in-the-future-that-isnt-possible-currently-what-would-it-be-and-why\">Is there any metadata that you’d like to be able to include with your publishing records in the future that isn’t possible currently? What would it be and why?</h3>\n<p>DP: CRediT roles would be great because it could give greater insight into collaboration within and across disciplines, it could allow for some automation and integration opportunities in the peer review process, and maybe it would visualize aspects of authors’ careers.</p>\n<p>DH: I second capturing CRediT roles. What would be really interesting is also creating a standard that quantifies the accessibility conformance/rating of content and passing that into Crossref.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-key-lesson-you-learned-from-this-project\">What was the key lesson you learned from this project?</h3>\n<p>DP: Incremental change can be just as challenging as a massive overhaul, and so it’s important to reevaluate your goals along the way—things always change. There have been cases where we were able to do things that we hadn’t initially thought were feasible.</p>\n<p>DH: Always keep the larger goal in mind and remember that any project can birth a new project. Everything does not happen at once.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-your-next-big-challenge-for-2023\">What’s your next big challenge for 2023?</h3>\n<p>DP: There is a lot to contend with in the industry right now, and in addition to that we are going through some serious infrastructure changes in our program. With all that madness comes many opportunities. For that reason, when I take a step back from the tactical implications of all that and what we are interested in doing, I think our biggest challenge in 2023 will be identifying what has made an impact and why.</p>\n<p>DH: In the short-term, it is making sure that none of our production process changes has negatively affected the past metadata work we spent so much time honing. Once that settles down, it will be determining the best way forward from a publishing perspective in handling true versioning and capturing accurate event data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"based-on-your-experience-what-would-be-your-advice-for-colleagues-from-other-scholarly-publishing-organizations\">Based on your experience, what would be your advice for colleagues from other scholarly publishing organizations?</h3>\n<p>DP: It can seem daunting, but the small wins can create momentum and do not have to be expensive. Remembering that your publishing program benefits as much as everyone else’s when you deposit more metadata can help refine your short-term and long-term priorities.</p>\n<p>DH: Don’t be afraid of making a mess of things. Messes are okay. They aren’t risky. They just reveal the clutter. And clutter gives one reason to clean things up.</p>\n<p>THANK YOU for the interview!</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-american-society-for-microbiology\">About the American Society for Microbiology</h3>\n<p>The American Society for Microbiology is one of the largest professional societies dedicated to the life sciences and is composed of 30,000 scientists and health practitioners.

Our open APIs now see over 1 <em>billion</em> queries per month. The metadata is ingested, displayed and redistributed by a vast, global array of systems and services that in whole or in part are often designed to point users to relevant content. It’s also heavily used by researchers, who author the content that is described in the metadata they analyze. It’s an interconnected supply chain of users large and small, occasional and entirely reliant on regular querying.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">Tl;dr</h2>\n<p>Crossref recently wrapped up our first <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/metadata-user/\" target=\"_blank\">Working Group</a> for users of the metadata, a group that plays a key role in discoverability and the metadata supply chain.

Why now?</h2>\n<p>A majority of Crossref metadata users rely on our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/\" target=\"_blank\">free, open APIs</a> and many are anonymous. A small but growing group of users pay for a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/\" target=\"_blank\">guaranteed service level option</a> and while their individual needs and feedback have long been integrated into Crossref’s work, as a group they provide a window into the workflows and use cases for the metadata of the scholarly record. As this use grows in <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">strategic importance</a>, to both Crossref and the wider community, it was clear that we might be overdue for a deeper dive into user workflows.</p>\n<p>In 2021, we surveyed these subscribers for their feedback and brought together a few volunteers over a series of 5 calls to dig into a number of topics specific to regular users of metadata. This group, the first primarily non-member <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/metadata-user/\" target=\"_blank\">working group</a> at Crossref, wrapped up in December 2022, and we are grateful for their time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Achraf Azhar, Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe (CCSD)</li>\n<li>Satam Choudhury, HighWire Press</li>\n<li>Nees Jan van Eck, CWTS-Leiden University</li>\n<li>Bethany Harris, Jisc</li>\n<li>Ajay Kumar, Nova Techset</li>\n<li>David Levy, Pubmill</li>\n<li>Bruno Ohana, biologit</li>\n<li>Michael Parkin, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)</li>\n<li>Axton Pitt, Litmaps</li>\n<li>Dave Schott, Copyright Clearance Center (CCC)</li>\n<li>Stephan Stahlschmidt, German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This post is intended to summarize the work we did, to highlight the role of metadata users in research communications, to provide a few ideas for future efforts and, crucially, to get your feedback on the findings and recommendations. Though this particular group set out to meet for a limited time, we hope this report helps facilitate ongoing conversations with the user community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"survey-highlights\">Survey Highlights</h2>\n<p>If you’re looking for an easy overview of users and use cases, here’s a great starting point.</p>\n<figure><img src='https://www.crossref.org/images/documentation/metadata-users-uses.png' alt='Metadata users and uses: metadata from Crossref APIs is used for a variety of purposes by many tools and services' title='' width='75%'></figure>\n<button id=\"show-img\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#image32\">Show image</button>\n<div id=\"image32\" class=\"modal fade\" aria-labelledby=\"my-modalLabel\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">\n<div class=\"modal-content\" >\n<div class=\"modal-body\">\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">×</button>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/documentation/metadata-users-uses.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you interpret this graphic to mean that there is a lot of variety centered on a few high level use cases, the survey and our experiences with users certainly supports that. A few key takeaways from the 2021 survey may be useful context:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frequency of use</strong>: At least 60% of respondents query metadata on a daily basis</li>\n<li><strong>Use cases</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Finding and enhancing metadata as well as using it for general discovery are all common use cases</li>\n<li>For most users, matching DOIs and citations is a common need but for a significant group, it is their primary use case</li>\n<li>Analyzing the corpus for research was a consistent use case for 13% of respondents</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Metadata of particular interest</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstracts are the most desirable non-bibliographic metadata, followed by affiliation information, including RORs\n<ul>\n<li>Some other elements (beyond citation information) that respondents find useful are:\n<ul>\n<li>Corrections and retractions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-practices/best-practices/relationships/\">Relationship metadata</a></li>\n<li>Book chapters</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/come-and-get-your-grant-metadata/\">Grant information</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: The survey did not ask about references but we are frequently asked why they’re not included more often.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that about a third of respondents said that correct metadata is more important to them than any particular element.</p>\n<p>There is more to this survey that isn’t covered here but it was kept fairly short to help with the response rate. Knowing we would have some focused time to discuss issues too numerous or nuanced to reasonably address in a survey, we compiled a long list of questions and topics for the Working Group then followed up with a second, more detailed survey to kick off the meeting series.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-we-set-out-to-address\">What we set out to address</h2>\n<p>We had three primary goals for this Working Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlight the efforts of metadata users in enabling discovery and discoverability</li>\n<li>Determine direction(s) for improved engagement</li>\n<li>Inform the Crossref product development <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/02zsQaeA/crossref-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> for <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/\">metadata retrieval services</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, everyone involved had some questions and topics of interest to cover, including (but not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding publisher workflows</li>\n<li>How best to introduce changes, e.g. for a high volume of updated records</li>\n<li>Understanding the Crossref schema</li>\n<li>Query efficiencies, i.e. ‘tips and tricks’ (here for the REST API)</li>\n<li>Which scripts, tools and/or programs are used in workflows</li>\n<li>What other metadata sources are used</li>\n<li>What kind of normalization or processing is done on ingest</li>\n<li>How metadata errors are handled</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-did-we-learn\">What did we learn?</h2>\n<p><strong>Workflows</strong><br>\nI started with the admittedly ambitious goal of collecting a library of workflows. After a few years of working with users, I learned never to assume what a user was doing with the metadata, why or how. For example, some subscribers use Plus snapshots (a monthly set of all records), regularly or occasionally and some don’t use them at all. Understanding why users make the choices they do is always helpful.</p>\n<p>In my experience, workflows are frequently characterized as “set it and forget it.” It’s hard to know how often and how easily they might be adapted when, for example, a new record type like peer review reports becomes available. So, it’s worth exploring when and how to highlight to users changes that might be of interest.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, half the group had their workflows mostly or fully documented. The rest are partially documented, not documented at all or the availability of documentation was unknown. Helping users document their workflows, to the extent possible, should be a mutually beneficial effort to explore going forward. We&rsquo;re doing similar work with the aim of making ours more transparent and replicable.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback on subscriber services</strong><br>\nUser feedback might be the most obvious and directly consequential work of this group, at least for Crossref - understanding how well the services used meet their needs and what might be improved.</p>\n<p>One frequent suggestion for improvement is faster response time on queries. This is an area we’ve focused on for some time, because refining queries to be <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-the-crossref-rest-api/\">more efficient</a> is often the most straightforward way to improve response times and one reason for the emphasis on workflows.</p>\n<p>We also discussed the possibility of whether or how to notify users of changes of interest. Just defining “change” is complex since they are so frequent and may often be considered very minor. We’ve been experimenting a bit over the past few years with notifying these users in cases where we’re aware of upcoming large volumes of changes, which is sometimes the case when landing page URLs are updated due to a platform change, for example. It was incredibly useful to discuss with the group what volume of records would be a useful threshold to trigger a notification (100K if you’re curious).</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most common feedback we get from all users is on the metadata itself and the myriad <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/flies-in-your-metadata-ointment/\">quality issues</a> involved. The group spent a fair amount of time discussing how this affects their work and shared a few examples of notable concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Author name issues, e.g. ‘Anonymous’ is an option for authors but that or things like ‘n/a’ are sometimes used in surname fields</li>\n<li>Invalid DOIs are sometimes found in reference lists</li>\n<li>Garbled characters from text not rendering properly</li>\n<li>Affiliation information is often not included or incomplete (e.g. doesn’t include RORs)</li>\n<li>Inconsistencies in commonly included information, e.g. ISSNs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s worth noting that a common misunderstanding - not just among users - is <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/required-recommended-elements/\">what is required</a> in the metadata. Users nearly always expect more metadata and more consistency than is actually available. The introduction of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\">Participation Reports</a> a few years ago was a very useful start to what is an ongoing discussion about the variable nature of metadata quality and completeness.</p>\n<p><strong>Users in the metadata supply chain</strong><br>\nA few years ago, our colleague Joe Wass used <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/\">Event Data</a> to put together this chart of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/where-do-doi-clicks-come-from/\">referrals from non-publisher sources</a> in 2015.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/month-top-10-filtered-domains-1.png\" alt=\"month-top-10-filtered-domains\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>The role of metadata users in discoverability of content is key in my view and one that often doesn’t get enough attention, especially given that the systems and services that use this information often use it to point their own users to relevant resources. And because they work so closely with the metadata, users frequently report errors and so serve as a sort of de facto quality control. So, unfortunately, the effects of incomplete or incorrect metadata on these users might be the most powerful way to highlight the need for more and better metadata.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-recommendations\">What are the recommendations?</h2>\n<p>In discussions with the Working Group, a few themes emerged, largely around best practices, which, by their nature, tend to be aspirational.</p>\n<p>If you’re not already familiar with the <a href=\"https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-personas/\" target=\"_blank\">personas</a> and <a href=\"https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Practices</a> and <a href=\"https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-principles/\" target=\"_blank\">Principles</a> of Metadata 2020, that is a useful starting point (I am admittedly biased here!) and many are echoed in the following recommendations:</p>\n<p><strong>For users:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Document and periodically review workflows</li>\n<li>Report errors to members or to <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">Crossref support</a> and reflect corrections when they’re made (metadata and content)</li>\n<li>Understand what <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/required-recommended-elements/\">is and isn’t</a> in the metadata</li>\n<li>Follow <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-the-crossref-rest-api/\">best practices</a> for using APIs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For Crossref:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define a set of metadata changes, e.g. to affiliations, to further the discussion around thresholds for notifying users of ‘high volumes’ of changes</li>\n<li>Provide an output schema.</li>\n<li>Continue refining the input schema to include information like preprint server name, journal article sub types (research article, review article, letter, editorial, etc.), corresponding author flags, raw funding statement texts, provenance information, etc.</li>\n<li>Collaborate on improving processes for reporting <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/flies-in-your-metadata-ointment/\">metadata errors</a> and making corrections and enhancements</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For metadata providers (publishers, funders and their service providers):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow <a href=\"https://metadata2020.org/learn-more/outcomes/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata 2020 Metadata Principles and Practices</a></li>\n<li>Consistency is important, e.g. using the same, correct relationship for preprint to VoR links for all records\n<ul>\n<li>Workarounds such as putting information into a field that is ‘close’ but not meant for it can be considered a kind of error</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Understand the roles and needs of users in amplifying your outputs</li>\n<li>Respond promptly to reports of metadata errors</li>\n<li>Whenever possible, provide PIDs (ORCID IDs, ROR IDs, etc.) in addition to (not as a substitute for) textual metadata</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-still-unclear-or-unfinished\">What is still unclear or unfinished?</h2>\n<p>Honestly, a lot. We knew from the outset that the group would conclude with much more work to be done, in part because there is so much variety under the umbrella of metadata users and many answers lead to more questions and in part because the metadata and the user community will continue to evolve. Even without a standing group that meets regularly, it’s very much an ongoing conversation and we invite you to join it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"now-its-your-turncan-you-help-fill-in-the-blanks\">Now it’s your turn–can you help fill in the blanks?</h2>\n<p>Does any or all of this resonate with you?

In January 2023, we repeated this analysis to see how the situation changed within ten months. Interested? Read on!</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The overall numbers changed a lot between March 2022 and January 2023:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the total number of registered grants doubled (from ~38k to ~76k)</li>\n<li>the total numbers of relationships established between grants and research outputs quadrupled (from 21k to 92k)</li>\n<li>the percentage of linked grants increased substantially (from 10% to 23%)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most of this growth can be attributed to one funder, the European Union.

It&rsquo;s also in keeping with <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/dont-take-it-from-us-funder-metadata-matters/\">recent studies</a> on how important funding and grant metadata is to help the community use this information in their own research.</p>\n<p>To meet these expectations, we need not only identifiers and metadata of grants, but also relationships between them and research outputs supported by them. Unfortunately, our schema does not make it easy to directly deposit such relationships, and so there are only a handful of them available. But we wouldn&rsquo;t let such a minor obstacle stop us! In March 2022 <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/follow-the-money-or-how-to-link-grants-to-research-outputs/\">we analysed the metadata of registered grants</a> and developed a simple matching approach to automatically link grants to research outputs supported by them. Back then, we were able to find 20,834 relationships, involving 17,082 research outputs and 3,858 grants (which was 10% of all registered grants).</p>\n<p>Now that we are seeing the accumulation of grant metadata being registered with Crossref, we have a bigger dataset to test these expectations against than we did a year ago. So we decided to do the analysis again. And the results are in, they&rsquo;re open, and they&rsquo;re positive. We&rsquo;ll explain below. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-methodology\">The methodology</h2>\n<p>To spare you from having to read the old analysis in detail, here is a very brief summary of the matching methodology. To find relationships between grants and research outputs, we iterated over all registered grants, and for each grant we searched for research outputs that looked like they might have been supported by this grant. We established a relationship between a grant and a research output if one of the following three scenarios was true:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The research output contained the DOI of the grant (deposited as the award number).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The award number in the grant was the same as the award number in the research output, the research output contained the funder ID, and one of the following was true: <br>\na. Funder ID in the grant was the same as the funder ID in the research output  <br>\nb. Funder ID in the grant replaced or was replaced by the funder ID in the research output <br>\nc. Funder ID in the grant was an ancestor or the descendant of the funder ID in the research output</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The award number in the grant was the same as the award number in the research output, the research output did not contain the funder ID, and one of the following was true:<br>\na. Funder name in the research output was the same as the funder name in the grant<br>\nb. Funder name in the research output was the same as the name of a funder that replaced or was replaced by the funder in the grant<br>\nc. Funder name in the research output was the same as the name of an ancestor or a descendant of the funder in the grant</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that the replaced/replaced-by relationships and ancestor/descendant hierarchy are taken from the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\">Funder Registry</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-results\">Current results</h2>\n<p>Since March 2022, six additional funders have started registering grants with us. As a result, the total number of grants doubled, and the total number of established relationships between grants and research outputs, linked grants, and linked research outputs quadrupled. Here is the comparison of the total numbers of grants, established relationships, linked grants, and linked research outputs in March 2022 and in January 2023:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/overall-statistics-blog-png\"\nalt=\"Graph titled overall statistics showing the comparison of the total numbers of grants, established relationships, linked grants, and linked research outputs in March 2022 and in January 2023\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</figure>\n<p><br>95% of grants registered within ten months between March 2022 and January 2023 were registered by one funder: the European Union. This suggests that this funder contributed a lot to this rapid increase in the number of established relationships. It looks like this funder&rsquo;s grant metadata is of high quality and matches well the funding information given in the research outputs supported by this funder&rsquo;s grants.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s also compare the breakdowns of all established relationships by the matching method:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/percentage-relationships-matching-method.png\"\nalt=\"Graph titled percentage of relationships by the matching method comparing the breakdowns of all established relationships by the matching method.\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</figure>\n<p><br>The distributions are a bit different. Currently, the percentage of relationships established based on the replaced/replaced-by relationship is much smaller than before, suggesting that newer data uses correct funder IDs instead of deprecated ones. Also, the percentage of the relationships matched by the funder ID increased from 40% to 48%, which is great, because this is the most reliable way of matching.</p>\n<p>And here we have the statistics broken down by grant registrants. Only funders with at least 100 registered grants are included. The table shows the number of relationships, grants, linked grants, and linked research outputs, and is sorted by the percentage of linked grants.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>funder</th>\n<th>relationships</th>\n<th>linked research outputs</th>\n<th>grants</th>\n<th>linked grants</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>European Union</td>\n<td>66,562</td>\n<td>60,630</td>\n<td>35,530</td>\n<td>12,688 (36%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</td>\n<td>93</td>\n<td>92</td>\n<td>113</td>\n<td>33 (29%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)</td>\n<td>15,584</td>\n<td>13,464</td>\n<td>9,923</td>\n<td>2,323 (23%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>James S.

One of the newest registrants, the European Union, is at the top of the table with 36% of their grants linked to research outputs. This further confirms the high quality of the metadata registered by this member. It is worth noticing that this member is responsible for the majority of the growth reported here as they cover Horizon Europe, the European Research Council, and many other funding bodies and schemes. </br><br>\n<p>Why are these percentages so low for some funders? It could be caused by systematic discrepancies between the award numbers attached to the grants and those reported in research outputs. It could also be the case that most grants registered by a given funder are new grants, and the research outputs supported by them simply have not been published yet. Time will tell!  </br></p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&rsquo;s next</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;re dedicating lots of time in 2023 to examine, evolve, and expose the matching we do and can do at Crossref across different metadata fields. We then plan to incorporate matching improvements into our services so that everyone can benefit.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t a standalone piece of work. As you can see, the more award metadata we have connected to grants by funders and connected to outputs by those who post or publish research, the better we&rsquo;ll be able to do this. To make it easier for more funders to participate, and based on funder feedback, we&rsquo;ve built <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/grant-registration-form/\">a simple tool for members to register their grants</a>. We will also work to help incorporate grant identifiers into publishing and funder workflows, and further our discussions with the funders in our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders/\">Funder Advisory Group</a> and the wider community, including working together with the Open Research Funders Group, the HRA, Altum, Europe PMC, the OSTP, and the ORCID Funder Interest Group. And there will be more to come as we work together to consolidate and build out important relationships between funding and outputs - for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"follow-up\">Follow-up</h2>\n<p>Every new thing takes time to get off the ground and to show evidence of its value. We&rsquo;ve seen a significant step forward recently with funders joining and contributing to the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus\">research nexus</a>. Publishers have been contributing funding data for years, and it&rsquo;s now becoming much clearer to see how these two communities and these two sets of metadata are coming together to make research smoother and easier to manage and evaluate. If you are ready to register grants, talk about linking up your outputs, or just want to learn more about this work, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Don't take it from us: Funder metadata matters","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/dont-take-it-from-us-funder-metadata-matters/","published":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Why the focus on funding information?

One common use case is researchers in bibliometrics and scientometrics (among other fields) doing meta analyses on the entire corpus of records. As we pass the 10 year mark for the Funder Registry and 5 years of funders joining Crossref as members to register their grants, it’s worth a look at some recent research that focuses specifically on funding information. After all, there is funding behind so much scholarly work it seems obvious that it would be routinely documented in the scholarly record. But it often isn’t and that’s a problem. These sources make clear the need for accurate funding information and the problems that the lack of it creates.</p>\n<p>First, a few notes for context on these sources and the issues they discuss :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The percent of records with funding information reached about 25% as of 2021. Not all items registered are the result of funding but surely it is much higher than 25% so there is considerable room for improvement. The authors cite publishers that omit funding information as well as those that include it routinely. Overall, society publishers are at the top of the list of those that do it well.</li>\n<li>Three of the four sources found problems in some cases confirming funding information from the metadata in the original sources. This initially surprised me though less so once I thought about the strange nature of metadata workflows.</li>\n<li>The complexity of fully and correctly acknowledging multiple sources of funding in any given publication is a recurring theme.</li>\n<li>All of the sources mention the need for manual work in analyzing funding and publication information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first two papers are from the same 2022 issue of <em>Quantitative Science Studies</em> and are complementary.</p>\n<p>Alexis-Michel Mugabushaka, Nees Jan van Eck, Ludo Waltman; <strong>Funding COVID-19 research: Insights from an exploratory analysis using open data infrastructures.</strong>\n<em>Quantitative Science Studies</em> 2022; 3 (3): 560–582. doi: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00212\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00212</a></p>\n<p>This first paper tackles the timely question of determining which funders have supported publications of COVID-19 research and compares coverage of funding data in Crossref to that in Scopus and Web of Science. Even with so much urgent attention focused on the pandemic, the authors found that only 17% of publications in the COVID-focused CORD-19 database have funding identified in their Crossref records.\nWe’re often asked about differences in the metadata (and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/cited-by/\" target=\"_blank\">citation counts</a>) between Crossref and other sources such as Scopus. In this case, both proprietary sources studied have more funder coverage.\nIf you are disappointed in these results or want to learn more, I encourage you to read the authors’ recommendations for improving funding data in Crossref or <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">get in touch with us</a>.</p>\n<p>Bianca Kramer, Hans de Jonge; <strong>The availability and completeness of open funder metadata: Case study for publications funded by the Dutch Research Council.</strong> <em>Quantitative Science Studies</em> 2022; 3 (3): 583–599. doi: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210</a></p>\n<p>This next paper focuses on a set of outputs funded by the <a href=\"https://www.nwo.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">NWO</a> (the Dutch Research Council). Since the funder is already known, the authors could look at multiple sources (Crossref and others) to see whether or where the NWO is correctly identified as the funder. This study also found better coverage than Crossref in proprietary sources like Web of Science. Knowing that not all outputs are the result of funded research, this paper provides a new and useful baseline for comparing percentages of coverage.\nDiscussions of research funding so often focus on the physical and life sciences so it’s very good to see that 37% of works in this study are in the humanities and social sciences.</p>\n<p>Borst, T., Mielck, J., Nannt, M., Riese, W.

This next paper focuses on automatic recognition of funders in economics papers in digital libraries.\nAn interesting complication described here is the inclusion of funding for open access fees in acknowledgments and while the authors conclude that automated text mining of funder information performs better than manual curation, they also state that manual indexing is still necessary “for a gold standard of reliable metadata.”</p>\n<p>Habermann, T.

The author shows how acronyms contribute to the need for manual analysis. He also spends some time on award numbers, which is one of the three <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/#00283\">funding elements</a> publishers can (and, as we’ve seen, should) include in their metadata. Award numbers are also a focus of this work and, unfortunately, another frequent reason for additional manual work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-common-theme-more-metadata-needed\">A common theme: More metadata needed</h2>\n<p>Though collectively, this research paints a fairly dim picture of the current availability, completeness and accuracy of existing funding information in publication metadata, all is not lost. This is a good opportunity to point out the value and availability of grant records since unique, persistent identifiers for grants (yes, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/come-and-get-your-grant-metadata/\">DOIs for grants</a>) paired with more and better funding metadata from publishers go a very long way to realizing the vision of the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/\">Research Nexus</a>. And it certainly would make things a whole lot easier for the researchers who use this open metadata to analyze the scholarly record for the rest of us.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Refocusing our Sponsors Program; a call for new Sponsors in specific countries","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/refocusing-our-sponsors-program-a-call-for-new-sponsors-in-specific-countries/","published":"Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Some small organizations who want to register metadata for their research and participate in Crossref are not able to do so due to financial, technical, or language barriers.

To attempt to reduce these barriers we have developed several programs to help facilitate membership. One of the most significant&mdash;and successful&mdash;has been our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/\">Sponsor program</a>.</p>\n<p>Sponsors are organizations that are generally not producing scholarly content themselves but work with or publish on behalf of groups of smaller organizations that wish to join Crossref but face barriers to do so independently.  Sponsors work directly with Crossref in order to provide billing, technical, and, if applicable, language support to Members.</p>\n<p>Because Sponsors are important partners in facilitating membership there is a high bar to meet to be accepted as a Sponsor. To ensure that an organization can accurately represent Crossref and has the resources to be successful we created <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/#sponsor-criteria\">a set of criteria</a> that must be met to be considered.</p>\n<p>Our Sponsors program has grown considerably over the last decade and has now become the primary route to membership for emerging markets and small or academic-adjacent publishing operations.</p>\n<p>The program began in 2012 with four Sponsors, based primarily in South Korea and Turkey, representing fewer than 100 members. In the next stage of development, the program covered Brazil, India, and Ukraine, and nearly 1300 members. At the end of 2022, the program had grown to over 100 sponsors from <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/about-sponsors/\">45 countries</a> representing over 11,000 of our members.</p>\n<p>Though the program continues to expand, there are still regions where we lack Sponsors, while having an abundance in others. We are working with members, ambassadors, and the community to help identify organizations that may be a fit with the Sponsor program and based in those regions where coverage is lacking.</p>\n<p>This January we announced our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/gem/\">Global Equitable Membership (GEM) Program</a> which offers relief from membership and content registration fees for members in the least economically-advantaged countries in the world. Eligibility for the program is based on a member&rsquo;s country on our curated list.</p>\n<p>Though the GEM program reduces financial barriers to becoming a member, many organizations still require technical assistance and local language support. Working with a Sponsor would help organizations overcome these burdens. However, there is little or no Sponsor coverage for organizations located in most GEM-eligible countries. That means that in places like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Senegal, where we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of growth, more organizations could join us if a suitable local Sponsor could support them.</p>\n<p>We have made the decision to pause accepting new Sponsors from regions where Sponsor numbers are already very high or not based in a GEM region. By doing so we can focus on growing the program in areas where there is the greatest need.</p>\n<p>We are also going to focus on how best to support our current 100+ Sponsors and work with them to evaluate ways to improve the program. We will bolster the training and resources, outreach activities, and solicit feedback on additional ways we can help.</p>\n<p>We would love to hear from organizations based in GEM countries who might consider becoming a Sponsor. But our invitation for Sponsors is not limited to the support for the GEM program. There are countries where the GEM program won&rsquo;t apply, but where growth is high and no Sponsor is present. In particular, we seek support in the following countries where member numbers are growing but could be better supported.</p>\n<center>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Country/state</th>\n<th>Region</th>\n<th>No. Crossref members</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Nigeria</td>\n<td>Sub-Saharan Africa (Western)</td>\n<td>99</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Philippines</td>\n<td>South-eastern Asia</td>\n<td>81</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kenya</td>\n<td>Sub-Saharan Africa (Eastern)</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Egypt</td>\n<td>Northern Africa</td>\n<td>26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sri Lanka</td>\n<td>Southern Asia</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>If your organization is based in one of these regions and supports or provides services to scholarly publishers in one of the above countries &mdash;please take a look <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/\">at the criteria</a> set out on our website and do get in touch to start the conversation if you think you can meet them.

However, as <a href=\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/09/30/the-experience-of-good-metadata-linking-metadata-to-research-impacts/\" target=\"_blank\">we’ve reflected on previously in the <em>Kitchen</em></a>, despite well-established information standards (e.g., persistent identifiers), our industry lacks a shared framework to measure the value and impact of the metadata we produce.</p>\n<p>In 2021, we embarked on a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/rfp-help-evaluate-the-reach-and-effects-of-metadata/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref-sponsored study</a> designed to measure how metadata impacts end-user experiences and contributes to the successful discovery of academic and research literature via the mainstream web. Specifically, we set out to learn if scholarly books with DOIs (and associated metadata) were more easily found in Google Scholar than those without DOIs.</p>\n<p>Initial results indicated that <strong>DOIs have an indirect influence on the discoverability of scholarly books in Google Scholar</strong> &ndash; however, we found no direct linkage between book DOIs and the quality of Google Scholar indexing or users’ ability to access the full text via search-result links. Although Google Scholar claims to not use DOI metadata in its search index, the results of our mixed-methods study of 100+ books (from 20 publishers) demonstrate that books with DOIs are generally more discoverable than those without DOIs.</p>\n<p>As we finalize our analysis, we are <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/t/with-or-without-measuring-impacts-of-books-metadata/3058\" target=\"_blank\">sharing some early results</a> and inviting input from our community. What relevant lessons can we glean from this exercise? What changes might book publishers consider based on the outcomes of this study?</p>\n<h2 id=\"background-on-the-study\">Background on the study</h2>\n<p>This study was designed to evaluate metadata impacts &amp; benefits to users. Given its popularity with a range of stakeholders in our industry, we set out to measure metadata impacts on discoverability in the mainstream web – namely, Google Scholar.</p>\n<p>Our test method and analysis rubric was developed based on our own information-user research, in particular how readers search and retrieve scholarly ebooks, as well as published studies about academic information experiences and research practices. We rated the search performance of more than 100 scholarly books using preset test queries (two for each title). The books tested in this study came from publishers of all sorts and sizes, and represent both monographs and edited volumes from a range of fields; some were open access and others were published under traditional licensing models.</p>\n<p>We developed and executed known-item test searches that were designed to simulate common researcher practices. Heuristic analysis of the search results was used to rate the search performance on a 5-point scoring rubric, which was designed to measure the degree of friction in locating the book in question. This method allowed us to assess specific book and metadata attributes by their search performance scores to assess the impact of book metadata on content discoverability in Google Scholar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"results-and-findings\">Results and findings</h2>\n<p>In this study, we learned that high-value fields include the primary title paired with subtitles, author/editor surnames and/or field of study. Queries using full book titles performed the best across the board. Those using publication dates and/or author/editor surnames and/or publisher names, but without the book title, were the lowest performers.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, our discoverability scores show no significant variation in performance by the type of book, whether edited or authored. Open-access titles performed somewhat better than traditional ones. Books covering humanities and social science fields performed a bit better than STM books, but only by a slim difference (that is not statistically significant).</p>\n<p>We primarily tested the discoverability of book titles, from equal numbers of books with and without chapter-level DOIs. We ran similar tests for chapter-title discoverability but found the majority of test queries for chapters lead users to the full book itself. While books without title-level DOIs were found to be less discoverable, we did not find a measurable difference between books with or without chapter-level DOIs. (Note: All books in this study with chapter-level DOIs assigned also carried a title-level DOI, which was found to be fairly common.)</p>\n<p>Based on these results, we are developing a theory that <strong>books with DOIs perform better in Google Scholar because they benefit from the structured, open metadata associated</strong> with those DOIs – which are used by hundreds of platforms and services, and therefore are “seeded” throughout the mainstream web, which Scholar may draw on for indexing, linking, etc. That said, however, these results also suggest that publishers are best served by a metadata strategy that is well attuned to the protocols expected of each channel for book search and discovery. In a recent conversation about our findings, Anurag Acharya himself noted that these results underscore the need for publishers to invest in the robust construction and broad distribution of book metadata.</p>\n<p>In this study, we have observed that the metadata protocols surrounding Google Scholar are not fully integrated into our industry’s established scholarly information standards bodies, like NISO, or infrastructure organizations, like Crossref. While some mainstream data standards prevail in the Scholar index, like the use of schema.org and HTTP, some key metadata attributes seem to be lacking. For example, an indicator of the type of scholarly book (monograph, handbook, etc.) would improve Google Scholar’s search index and could be used to filter search results, thereby improving users’ experiences discovering scholarly books. One clear challenge for book publishers today is the fact that Google Scholar operates outside of our community-governed scholarly information infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next</h2>\n<p>While this study focused on Google Scholar, the results and lessons learned are applicable to other mainstream channels of information seeking/discovery. Our report, due out spring 2023, will contribute to the literature intended to support user-centric information systems design and content architecture by scholarly publishers and service providers.</p>\n<p>As we write up our findings, we intend to develop a framework that can help publishers and others measure the impact of their work to enrich and distribute scholarly metadata. We hope this first systematic review of the impacts of metadata on the discoverability of books in Google Scholar will provide valuable insights for this community.

Our goal of creating the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus\">Research Nexus</a>&mdash;a rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society&mdash;can only be achieved by ensuring that participation in Crossref is accessible to all. Building a network for the global community must include input from all of the global community. </p>\n<p>Although Crossref membership is open to all organizations that produce scholarly and professional materials, cost and technical challenges can be barriers to joining for many organizations. To address some of these challenges, we created our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/about-sponsors/\">Sponsors Program</a>, which provides technical, financial and local language support. We also collaborate with the Public Knowledge Project on the <a href=\"https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/crossref-ojs-manual/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Journals Platform</a> to develop plugins for OJS users.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we had a limited &lsquo;fee assistance&rsquo; program to waive the content registration fees for members working under specific Sponsor arrangements, including INASP, and African Journals Online (AJOL). Learning from the experiences of such successful partnerships, starting in January 2023, we are expanding this program to provide greater membership equitability and accessibility to organizations located in the least economically-advantaged countries in the world through our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/gem/\">Global Equitable Membership</a> (GEM) Program.

From January 2023, organizations based in countries listed in our GEM program will be eligible to join Crossref and contribute with their metadata to a robust scholarly record at no cost.

It will be equally useful for publishers and other systems that operate in the scholarly research ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In response to calls from our community for more specifics, this post:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provides an overview of the specific ways that Crossref (along with organisations and initiatives like <a href=\"https://datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite</a>, <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID</a>, and <a href=\"https://ror.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ROR</a>) helps U.S. federal agencies&mdash;and indeed any other funder&mdash;meet critical aspects of the recommendations.</li>\n<li>Restates our intent to collaborate with all stakeholders in the scholarly research ecosystem, including the OSTP, the US federal agencies, our existing funder, publisher, and university members, to support the recommendation as plans develop.</li>\n<li>References the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/grants\">work and adoption of Crossref Grant DOIs</a>, including analyses of existing metadata matching funding to outputs.</li>\n<li>Highlights that what’s outlined in the memo aligns with our longstanding mission to capture and maintain the scholarly record and our vision of the Research Nexus, as we describe in our current blog series, regarding our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/\">role in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record (ISR)</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"infrastructure-already-exists-to-support-funder-goals-it-just-needs-more-adoption\">Infrastructure already exists to support funder goals; it just needs more adoption</h2>\n<p>Ensuring free, immediate, and equitable access to metadata that captures the scholarly record is an essential part of meeting the aims of the memo but also supporting Open Science globally.</p>\n<p>In September, Crossref ORCID, DataCite, and ROR participated in the <a href=\"https://altum.com/forum-on-grants-management/\" target=\"_blank\">2022 Forum on Global Grants Management</a> run by Altum and the summary provides a good example of the importance of open infrastructure and open metadata to the goals of Open Science:</p>\n<div class=\"shortcode-divwrap blue-highlight\">\n<span>Open Science begins with open infrastructure: Attendees agreed that Open Science relies on many other &lsquo;opens’ – most notably, open metadata, open infrastructure, and open governance. Metadata and DOIs (digital object identifiers) for publications, grants, and research outputs, are essential to illuminate the connections that exist between funding and outcomes. That metadata runs on infrastructure powered by organizations such as Crossref, ORCID, ROR, and DataCite.</span>\n</div>\n<p>As a foundational scholarly infrastructure committed to meeting the <a href=\"https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a> of governance, insurance, and sustainability, Crossref plays an essential role in implementing and supporting key aspects of the guidance. For many years, we have been focused on the integrity of the scholarly record (ISR), and the shared vision to collectively achieve what we call the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/\">Research Nexus</a>, which is described as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organisations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Metadata&mdash;including persistent identifiers and relationships between different research objects&mdash;is the foundation of the Research Nexus and is critical to openly and sustainably fulfilling the OSTP memo&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>\n<p>This topic of open metadata and identifiers isn’t just an issue for research resulting from US federal funding. We are working to implement open scholarly infrastructure globally, bringing significant benefits to the whole scholarly research ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The current situation brings to mind the William Gibson quote, “<a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/01/24/future-has-arrived/\" target=\"_blank\">The future is already here - it’s just not evenly distributed yet</a>”. Much of the open infrastructure to support the identifier, metadata and reporting requirements of the OSTP memo already exists, but it is unevenly implemented. Increased collaboration and effort will be needed to bring this all to fruition.</p>\n<p>We set out below some steps that all stakeholders can take to meet not just the OSTP guidelines, but Open Science goals more broadly, and globally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-adoption-look-like-how-exactly-do-funders-and-other-stakeholders-work-with-this-infrastructure\">What does ‘adoption’ look like? How exactly do funders and other stakeholders work with this infrastructure?</h2>\n<p>The OSTP memo calls for specific actions concerning metadata and identifiers where, fortunately, open and global solutions already exist.</p>\n<p>For example, item 4 a) says, “<em>Collect and make publicly available appropriate metadata associated with scholarly publications and data resulting from federally funded research.</em>” Crossref and DataCite make metadata, including persistent identifiers (DOIs to be specific), openly available for a broad range of research objects from <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">publications</a> to <a href=\"https://search.datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">data</a>. Item 4 b) reads, “<em>Assign unique digital persistent identifiers to all scientific research and development awards and intramural research protocols</em>”. Again, federal agencies and other funders are already <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/grants/\">joining</a> to register awards and grants and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/come-and-get-your-grant-metadata\">distribute these records openly</a> through Crossref. However, this is an example of uneven adoption as registering awards and grants with DOIs is only being done by a few funders so far, which needs to increase.</p>\n<h4 id=\"here-is-an-ideal-workflow-that-funders-and-publishers-can-already-follow\">Here is an ideal workflow that funders and publishers can already follow</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Funders join Crossref to register grants and awards (or indeed any other object such as reports). They apply on our website, accept our terms, and provide key information such as contact details. An annual membership fee ranges from $200-$1200 USD.</li>\n<li>Funders and publishers collect ROR IDs and authenticated ORCID iDs for all authors/awardees and their affiliations.</li>\n<li>Funders register a Crossref DOI for the award/grant, including awardees’ ORCID iDs and ROR IDs. They send us XML information about the grant (note that we will imminently release an online form to make it easier for the less technical funders). Many funder members register the metadata through a third party, such as Altum (if they use ProposalCentral) or Europe PMC.</li>\n<li>At the same time, funders update the awardees’ ORCID record directly with the Crossref Grant DOI and metadata.</li>\n<li>Grantees produce research objects and outputs such as data, protocols, code, preprints, articles, conference papers, book chapters, etc.</li>\n<li>These objects are registered with Crossref or DataCite, and DOIs are created by the publisher or repository members who include ORCID iDs, Crossref Grant DOIs (gathered from the author), ROR IDs for affiliations for all contributors, and other key metadata such as licensing information, and in the case of publications - references and abstracts. Note that the publisher works its magic (actually, publishers do a lot of editorial and production work, such as including data citations in the references using DataCite DOIs for the data in data repositories).</li>\n<li>On the Crossref side, we do a bunch of processing and matching and are planning to refine this and do more. Sometimes relationships are notified and added, such as data citation, preprints related to articles or funding acknowledgements converted from free text to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\">Open Funder Registry IDs</a> and names.</li>\n<li>Grant records with Crossref DOIs are now part of the scholarly record. All stakeholders may retrieve the open metadata and relationships through our public APIs. Crossref and DataCite will always provide open metadata, as safeguarded by our respective commitments to POSI.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"shortcode-divwrap blue-highlight\">\n<span><p>Anyone can use the open metadata registered with Crossref, DataCite and ORCID as connections have been established between (ideally all) research objects and entities through open metadata and identifiers.

There is now a range of preprint servers, some subject-specific, some based on a particular geographical area, and others linked to publishers or individual journals in addition to generalist platforms.

These ambitions lay out how we want to operate - to be open in our governance, in our membership and also in our source code and data. And it&rsquo;s that openness of source code that&rsquo;s the reason for my post today - on 26th September 2022, our first collaboration with the <a href=\"https://jsonforms.io/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON Forms</a> open-source project was <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/releases/tag/v3.0.0\" target=\"_blank\">released into the wild</a>.</p>\n<p>Like most organisations, we depend heavily on open-source software for our operations - the software is universally available, generally high quality and &lsquo;free&rsquo;. And it&rsquo;s easy to take that dependency, and the associated dependency on free time and effort on the part of the maintainers, for granted - but that&rsquo;s not very sustainable. In fact, we believe relying on open-source software without helping to sustain it is an anti-pattern, and this project marks the start of our efforts to make funding open-source software a standard part of our technology budget.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/habanero\" target=\"_blank\">supported</a> or <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/rest_api\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> open-source software. Indeed for the past few years, all our new software is open source, and we&rsquo;re in the process of replacing old closed code with new, so that eventually all our code will be open source. But this is the first time we&rsquo;ve contributed extensively to something that isn&rsquo;t focussed primarily on us, and our services. This is a project that we will find very useful, but it is a general purpose tool, and it&rsquo;s already gaining traction in the community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background-and-motivations\">Background and motivations</h2>\n<p>A while back, I was tasked to do a quick <a href=\"http://agiledictionary.com/209/spike/\" target=\"_blank\">spike</a> of work on testing the theory that we could use automated form generation tools to bring new interfaces to our users more quickly, and make them easier for &ldquo;people who aren&rsquo;t devs&rdquo; to adapt and manage. We wanted to build a new user interface for registering content, and especially we wanted to make it easier for funders to register the grants they were awarding. As well as being more approachable by a less-technical audience, we also wanted these forms to be accessible (in terms of <a href=\"https://www.a11yproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a11y</a> and users of assistive technology) and localisable - we wanted a solution that would cater to the needs of our rapidly diversifying membership.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enter-json-schema\">Enter JSON Schema</h2>\n<p>We were clear about one side of the puzzle - we knew that we had to look beyond the XML ecosystem upon which much of our existing system is built - and landed on <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON Schema</a>. JSON Schema is a &lsquo;vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents&rsquo;. This means you can describe the shape you expect your data to take, and apply constraints-based validation to that. Which means, in terms of a form library, that you can infer the structure of the form and test that the data entered into it matches what you expect. More than that, you can use that built-in validation to provide error messages to help people get the data right, first time.</p>\n<p>Working backwards from the outcome, the argument for adopting JSON Schema is compelling. It provides a mechanism for checking that data you are handling (for example, receiving input from a form) conforms to the constraints that you declare, but also allows you to tell people up-front, in a human and machine-readable way, what structure and format you will accept. This closed-loop of data annotation and validation gets more appealing when you look at the wide adoption of JSON Schema across languages and libraries. You can pretty much guarantee that for whatever client or server -side technology you are using, there will be a JSON Schema validator for it. Being able to share schemas across your systems (and equally importantly, with third parties) moves JSON schema from &lsquo;just&rsquo; being about data validation, to a key supportive technology.</p>\n<p>Building a form derived from a JSON Schema is an equally attractive prospect. JSON Schema <a href=\"https://www.jviotti.com/assets/dissertation.pdf#page=23\" target=\"_blank\">was conceived</a> during the AjaxWorld conference in 2007 as a &lsquo;JSON-based format for defining the structure of JSON data&rsquo;, and its use as a form-generation tool is relatively new, but there is growing community interest. There is even a <a href=\"https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/discussions/70\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> about how to best create a JSON Schema vocabulary, specifically geared towards addressing some of the needs of form generation users. However, even in its current form, a JSON Schema can be passed to a library, and a very serviceable user interface appears. The devil is always in the detail, and the client-side libraries differ in their abilities to customise areas such as layout (you may not always want your form fields to appear in <strong>exactly</strong> the same order as they do in your JSON Schema), custom elements (you might want something that wasn&rsquo;t a form input, or that changes based on user input) and localisation. The ability to flexibly customise the appearance and behaviour of the interface was a key factor in our selection of a client-side form generation library.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choosing-a-library\">Choosing a library</h2>\n<p>The other side of the puzzle was less clear - choosing a UI library that would take this JSON Schema, and turn it into a useful, and usable, form. I made the prototype using the venerable <a href=\"https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form\" target=\"_blank\">React JSON Schema form</a>. This worked well as a proof of concept, but veered dramatically off our chosen Frontend stack of <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">VueJS</a> and <a href=\"https://vuetifyjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vuetify</a>, and had some architectural constraints that would limit the scope of customisations we could make to our forms. So I went off looking for libraries that would work with our stack and came up with <a href=\"https://koumoul-dev.github.io/vuetify-jsonschema-form/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">Vuetify JSON Schema Form</a>, and <a href=\"https://jsonforms.io/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON Forms</a>.</p>\n<p>Vuetify JSON Schema Form matched our stack perfectly, but made some interesting decisions about the layout of data within the form, and that wouldn&rsquo;t suit our purposes without dramatic modification.</p>\n<p>JSON Forms was an abstracted library, with a core handling the JSON Schema transformation and validation, and separate rendering libraries to handle the form generation. This was great - they had renderers for Angular, React, and even some support for VueJS. But not Vuetify.</p>\n<p>Clearly, we were going to have to make something.</p>\n<p>We made contact with the maintainers of both short-listed libraries to see how we could collaborate in creating a tool that would meet all of our (and hopefully, much of the wider community&rsquo;s) requirements. Both maintainers were very helpful, and we had constructive discussions in both cases. In the end, we decided that the abstracted nature of the JSON Forms project was a better fit for our needs, providing a flexible platform on which we - and others - could extend. We were fortunate to receive funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (Grant Agreement #10485) in order to accelerate this work, so we could provide a Grant Registration UI more quickly. We paid a large portion of that funding to the library maintainers, and Crossref contributed a portion of my time on the project. This allowed us to enter into an agreement with <a href=\"https://eclipsesource.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EclipseSource</a>, the maintainers of JSON Forms, to collaboratively develop the new VueJS and Vuetify renderer library. Stefan Dirix, the lead maintainer, worked with me to build it.</p>\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t forget about Vuetify JSON Schema Form though, and by way of appreciation for their help in the early stages, Crossref made a contribution towards the continued development of that library.</p>\n<h2 id=\"json-forms---now-with-vuetify\">JSON Forms - now with Vuetify</h2>\n<p>Work started on the <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vuetify-renderers\" target=\"_blank\">JSON Forms Vuetify renderer set</a> in September 2021 - Stefan quickly created the first early prototypes of the new form renderers - but then we had a stroke of luck. Our repository received more input from the community. The one that made us sit up and take real notice was the news that someone else had already ported the JSON Forms React renderer set to Vue/Vuetify - and was <a href=\"https://jsonforms.discourse.group/t/unclear-on-how-to-implement-basic-styling-in-vue2-according-to-github-page/347/5\" target=\"_blank\">offering this</a> as a contribution. <a href=\"https://github.com/kchobantonov\" target=\"_blank\">Krasimir Chobantonov&rsquo;s</a> fantastic first contribution got <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vuetify-renderers/pull/5\" target=\"_blank\">merged in</a> at the end of the month. This propelled the project forward massively, and was an early validation of the value of working in the open. Needless to say, we were very grateful. Another example of the open source value chain was that Stefan - as the maintainer - could take the time to carefully review and tidy up the incoming code, so what was merged was the product of two great developers.</p>\n<p>Having this great head start meant we could turn our attention to one of the other big areas we wanted to get right - localisation. Traditionally, JSON Schema -generated forms have handled localisation (translation of text and adjustment of date and numerical formats) by wholesale duplication and translation of the schema. This is cumbersome, and doesn&rsquo;t integrate very well with custom error messages, nor external sources of interface messages (think form labels, descriptions, placeholders). So Stefan came up with a proposal, which we accepted, to add complete <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/pull/1825\" target=\"_blank\">i18n support</a> to the library. We now have a mechanism by which you can hook up a translation engine of your choice, and JSON forms will use that to lookup messages, before falling back to the validator (also localised!) and finally, the JSON Schema&rsquo;s defaults. This gives much stronger integration and allows the community to plug in their existing localisation methods - no wasted effort.</p>\n<p>Since the localisation addition, we&rsquo;ve been working on fine-tuning the layout engine, making bug fixes, and integrating more closely with the underlying Vuetify library. This allows developers to more easily use the existing Vuetify parameters to change the style and behaviour of their form widgets. Again, no wasted effort. </p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re lucky to have an active community - <a href=\"https://github.com/kchobantonov\" target=\"_blank\">@kchobantonov</a> continues to make great contributions and push the library forward in unexpected ways - and the library is gaining popularity, with an average of a few hundred downloads per day. </p>\n<p>Some of our funder members have already seen this work in action, and given their feedback on early iterations of the user interface that supports registering grant records. We&rsquo;ll be releasing this publicly very soon to get feedback from members - and then using that feedback to iterate on the grants registration form, and look towards extending it to other content types. </p>\n<h2 id=\"open-source-positivity\">Open source POSItivity</h2>\n<p>A continuous theme throughout this project has been the willingness of people working on these open source projects to be generous with their time and experience. Whether it has been form generation libraries, the <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON Schema project</a> or maintainers of <a href=\"https://fluent-vue.demivan.me/\" target=\"_blank\">localisation plug-ins</a> - help, advice and encouragement have never been far away. And that&rsquo;s appreciated. But it&rsquo;s not something that we, or any other organisation who relies on the software they produce, should take for granted. Open source software helps everyone who uses it, and there&rsquo;s a real opportunity within our community to make meaningful steps towards supporting its sustainability. Ironically, it&rsquo;s often the most-used general purpose tools that get the least attention. We can change that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"look-out-for-more\">Look out for more</h2>\n<p>Look out for more posts from the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/engineering/\">engineering</a> team, coming soon!</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jviotti.com/assets/dissertation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">JSON Binpack: A space-efficient schema-driven and schema-less binary serialization specification based on JSON Schema</a> (Chapter 3.2.1 History and Relevance)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20071026190426/http://www.json.com/2007/09/27/json-schema-proposal-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20071026190426/http://www.json.com/2007/09/27/json-schema-proposal-collaboration/</a></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"ISR part three: Where does Crossref have the most impact on helping the community to assess the trustworthiness of the scholarly record?","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-three-where-does-crossref-have-the-most-impact-on-helping-the-community-to-assess-the-trustworthiness-of-the-scholarly-record/","published":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Ans: metadata and services are all underpinned by POSI.

I was a nightmare English Literature student. &lsquo;Was Macbeth purely a villain?&rsquo; &lsquo;No&rsquo;. *leaves exam*</p>\n<p>Just like not giving one-word answers to exam questions, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/\">playing our role in the integrity of the scholarly record</a> and helping our members enhance theirs takes thought, explanation, transparency, and work.</p>\n<p>Some of the elements Amanda outlines in the previous posts in this series (<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/\">Part 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-2-how-our-membership-approach-helps-to-preserve-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/\">Part 2)</a> really resonated from a product perspective:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must be cautious that our best practices for demonstrating legitimacy and identifying deceptive behaviour do not raise already-high barriers for emerging publications or organizations that present themselves in ways that some may not recognize as professional standards. Disruption is different from deception. Crossref has an opportunity to think about how to identify deceptive actions and pair that with our efforts to bring more people on board and support their full participation in our ecosystem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have the means or desire to be the arbiter of research quality (whatever that means). However, we operate neutrally, at the center of scholarly communications, and we can help develop a shared consensus or framework. Our metadata elements and tools can be positioned to signal or detect trustworthiness. An important distinction is that we can play a role in assessing legitimacy (activities of the actors) but not in quality (calibre of the content itself).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"crossref-has-lots-of-plans-and-lots-to-do-to-improve-our-role-in-isr\">Crossref has lots of plans (and lots to do) to improve our role in ISR </h2>\n<p>Rather than a long list of things we want to do in terms of tools, services, and functionality, it feels more manageable to break this work into three key areas.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1--collecting-better-information-in-better-ways\">1. Collecting better information in better ways</h4>\n<p>We think many elements of the metadata our members record with us help expose important information about the research, e.g., authors, publication dates, and abstracts. We also help our members assess submissions for originality via our Similarity Check service, and the ongoing migration to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/similarity-check-news-ithenticate-v2.0-ready-for-launch/\">iThenticate V2</a> aims to better support this aspect of the publication process.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, as Amanda points out, &lsquo;once members start registering their content, their metadata speaks about their practices&rsquo;. Seeing who published a work along with the metadata they provide; validated ORCID IDs to identify the authors, reference lists and links to related research and data, and important updates to the work via Crossmark, all contribute to showing not just the &lsquo;what&rsquo; but the &lsquo;how&rsquo; so that the community can use that information to support their decision-making.</p>\n<p>I always want to stress that this work is not just an &lsquo;ask&rsquo; for our members. We are moving in the same direction as we improve the things we do to support organizations in registering their records with us, answering their questions, working with partner organizations like <a href=\"https://publicknowledge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PKP</a>, consulting with our community on pain points, and thinking about how we can better enhance and facilitate their work. We&rsquo;ve been fortunate that our community has taken the time to engage in discussions with Turnitin on iThenticate improvements, do user testing sessions as we build simple user interfaces to record grants, lead calls and conversations on improving grant metadata and supporting the uptake of ROR and data citation, and provide thoughtful feedback on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/6z7s3\" target=\"_blank\">our recent preprint on CRE metadata</a>. This all helps us to explain, structure, and prioritize our product work.</p>\n<p>There are also some closely related R&amp;D-led projects that are already informing our thinking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A more responsive version of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">participation reports</a> so that it&rsquo;s easier for members to identify gaps in their metadata and compare against others.</li>\n<li>Making it easier to get metadata back in a format where members can easily redeposit it.</li>\n<li>Better matching to help us and our members augment the metadata they send us to add value to the work we all do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We said in the previous blog posts that we&rsquo;ll pose questions about what kinds of metadata give what kind of levels of trustworthiness, and have previously highlighted the following activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reporting corrections and retractions through <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/\">Crossmark</a> metadata. We know that our members are collecting this information, but often it isn&rsquo;t making it through metadata workflows to us. We&rsquo;re part of the <a href=\"https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/crec\" target=\"_blank\">NISO CREC (Communication of Retractions, Removals, and Expressions of Concern) working group</a> with many of our members and metadata users, as this feels like something critical to address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assessing originality using <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/\">Similarity Check</a>. On average, we&rsquo;re seeing 320 new Similarity Check subscribers each year, with over 10 million checks being done each year by our members. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Establishing provenance and stakeholders through ORCID and ROR. At the time of writing, we have over 30,000 ROR IDs in Crossref, and this is growing steadily across different content types. ROR is keen to support adoption and so are we. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Acknowledging funding and other support through the use of the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\">Open Funder Registry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/grants/\">registering grants metadata</a>. This has improved in quality and completeness since we launched the Funder Registry in 2014 and with more comprehensive support for grants in more recent years. But we still have work to do, as this paper by Kramer and de Jonge points out: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210\" target=\"_blank\">The availability and completeness of open funder metadata</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/data-citation/\">Citing data</a> for transparency and reproducibility, including <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/data-citation/\">linking to related research data</a>. Scholix, MDC and STM Research Data groups. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Demonstrating open peer review by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/peer-reviews/\">registering peer review reports</a>. Members have already recorded over 300,000 peer reviews with Crossref, opening up this information on their processes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In your organization, what weight do you give these? We know that some of our members register some of these things in more volume than others - is that due to their perceived value, technical limitations, or &lsquo;we&rsquo;re working on it, give us time?&rsquo; Do you think of them in the context of the integrity of the record or are we off the mark? Are there other things we haven&rsquo;t mentioned in this blog that we could capture, report on and highlight? </p>\n<h4 id=\"2--disseminating-this-information-and-supporting-its-downstream-use\">2. Disseminating this information and supporting its downstream use</h4>\n<p>We want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to access and use the metadata our members register with us. Especially as some of the biggest metadata users are our members and, more selfishly, us! But there&rsquo;s no point collecting metadata to support ISR if it&rsquo;s unwieldy and difficult to access and use.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re working on a project, described in the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/seeing-your-place-in-the-research-nexus/\">mid-year community update</a> by a number of my colleagues to break down internal metadata silos and model it in a more flexible way. This will lend itself to better information collection and exchange, and support of the Research Nexus by building a relationships API to let anyone see all of the relationships Crossref can see between a given work and well, anything else related to it (citations, links to preprints, links to data to name but a few).</p>\n<p>Part of that work will involve supplementing the metadata our members register with high-quality, curated data from selected sources, making it clear where those assertions have come from.</p>\n<p>We want our API to perform consistently and well, to contain all the metadata our members register, handle it appropriately, and be able to keep the information in it up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Our API will underpin the reports we provide our members (among other things) so that we can provide simple interfaces for organizations to check how they&rsquo;re doing along with more functional requests. Do their DOIs resolve? Are they submitting metadata updates when they publish a correction? How much will they be billed in a given quarter? We have a lot of internal reporting and need to build more, and if we want to use these, chances are many others do too, so we should open those up.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3--trying-to-live-up-to-posi-to-underpin-this-work\">3. Trying to live up to POSI to underpin this work</h4>\n<p>When I see a new project, initiative, tool or service in the research ecosystem the first thing I want to do is find out about the organization itself so that I can base some decisions on that. <a href=\"https://barbarafister.net/libraries/lateral-reading-and-information-systems-in-the-age-of-distrust/\" target=\"_blank\">Lateral reading</a> in action.</p>\n<p>At Crossref, we want to show who we are beyond just our tools, services, and products and be transparent about our values. That&rsquo;s why we have <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-board-votes-to-adopt-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/\">adopted the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a> or POSI for short. Now we need to meet these principles and we&rsquo;re <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/posi-fan-tutte/\">working towards that</a>. POSI proposes three areas that an Open Infrastructure organization like Crossref can address to garner the trust of the broader scholarly community: accountability (governance), funding (sustainability), and protection of community interests (insurance). POSI also proposes a set of concrete commitments that an organization can make to build community trust in each area.</p>\n<p>So POSI isn&rsquo;t just opening code and metadata, it&rsquo;s telling our community how we handle membership, governance, product development, technical and financial stability and security, holding our hands up when we&rsquo;ve got something wrong, and actively looking to improve upon the things we do.</p>\n<p>Are you still reading? If so, you&rsquo;ve done better than many of my examiners, I&rsquo;m sure. So stay with us as we work together to ensure we bring quality, transparency, and integrity to the work we all do.</p>\n<p>The next part in this series will report back on the feedback and discussions and potentially propose some new or adjusted priorities.

We’re a global community of members with content in all disciplines, in many formats, with all kinds of business models - research institutions, publishers, government agencies, research funders, banks, museums and many more. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, if your content is likely to be cited in the research ecosystem and you consider it part of the evidence trail, then you’re eligible to join.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We ask organisations to complete an online application form and accept our member terms. On receipt of the application, we run a few very basic checks to ensure that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The applicant can meet the membership criteria and seems to have the capacity to fulfill the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/terms/\">obligations</a> (and follow our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/code-of-conduct/\">code of conduct</a>).</li>\n<li>We are legally permitted to accept them as a member (for example, we can’t accept applications from some countries due to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/sanctions/\">sanctions</a>.</li>\n<li>They haven&rsquo;t previously been a member of Crossref whose membership was <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/revocation/\">revoked</a>.</li>\n<li>They haven&rsquo;t misrepresented themselves in the application (such as their location).</li>\n<li>The applicant or an affiliate is not already a member of Crossref (so that we can advise they join under a single membership fee).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As long as the applicant can meet these requirements, and as long as they are able to pay any membership fees upfront for their first year of membership, they are able to become a Crossref member, get a DOI prefix, and start registering their metadata to share it with the global scholarly community. </p>\n<p>We are aware that some organisations in some regions may not be able to join Crossref independently. There may be barriers for them - the cost of membership fees, the fact that we only accept payment in US dollars, language barriers or technical barriers. </p>\n<p>To help increase participation globally, we work with <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/about-sponsors/\">sponsors</a> in some regions. All sponsors facilitate membership for organisations who wish to participate in Crossref. They pay one central membership fee on behalf of all the members they work with, and they also pay content registration fees on behalf of their members. Many sponsors register content on behalf of their members, and even if they don’t, most provide local language and technical support. Sponsors are able to charge for their services, but it can be a very economical route for a member to join. In the last year, out of the 2,322 new members that we’ve welcomed, almost 58% joined via a sponsor.</p>\n<p>We also <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/gem/\">waive registration fees</a> for members in certain lower income countries who join via three of our sponsors, and we are planning to expand this program soon (pending board approval in November). [<em>EDIT 2022-November-23: The new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/gem\">Global Equitable Membership (GEM) Program</a> was approved and takes effect 1st January 2023</em>]</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-importance-of-keeping-barriers-to-entry-low\">The importance of keeping barriers to entry low </h2>\n<p>As you can see, the checks that we run on new applicants are fairly limited in scope. In the last year, we’ve welcomed 2,322 new members and we only declined 39 applications. And 34 of these declined applications were effectively from one organisation whose membership was revoked in 2019.</p>\n<p>Even this minimal set of checks takes a lot of research and keeps our member support specialists very busy - thank you <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/sally-jennings/\">Sally Jennings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/robbykha-rosalien/\">Robbykha Rosalien</a> (as well as contractors Kim and Collin). </p>\n<p>So why shouldn&rsquo;t we run more extensive checks on new member applicants? Why don’t we check the quality of their content, or that they are following best practices? Why don’t we decline membership for organisations that can’t demonstrate editorial integrity or that aren’t meeting 100% of the membership obligations from the start?</p>\n<p>Nevermind the additional capacity that more extensive checks on the over 200 applicants we receive per month would entail, it&rsquo;s more fitting with our mission to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>enable equitable participation; and</li>\n<li>focus on evidence:</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"equitable-participation\">Equitable participation</h3>\n<p>Inclusivity is very important to us - after all, one of our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/truths/\">organisational truths</a> (the guiding principles for everything we do) is “come one, come all”, and this is mirrored in the POSI principles that <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/posi-fan-tutte/\">commit us to broad stakeholder representation</a>. We know that for new organisations, it may take them a while to be able to completely fulfil the membership obligations. We support them with information to help them understand what being a participant in the Crossref community entails. These organisations would have less of a chance of developing better practices if we were to limit membership in Crossref to &lsquo;proven&rsquo; candidates. Besides, it would introduce a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition\" target=\"_blank\">race condition</a>; if joining and sharing metadata through Crossref is widely considered best practice, new entrants <em>need</em> to join Crossref in order to show that they are adopting best practices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust-signals-and-the-research-nexus\">Trust signals and the Research Nexus</h3>\n<p>Secondly, it&rsquo;s not our role to make such a call; we don’t have the expertise to decide if an organisation would be considered “good” at what they are producing; there are other organisations guiding in this area, such as with the <a href=\"https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/principles-transparency-and-best-practice-scholarly-publishing\" target=\"_blank\">Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>. Instead, we focus on the decision-making tools, metadata, and relationships that can help provide trust signals for the community.</p>\n<p>Once members start registering their content, their activity and metadata speak about their practices – others in the community can process that metadata, combined with its wider context, and identify trust signals to make their own decisions. That metadata can only be shared in an open and machine-readable way if an organisation joins Crossref and starts registering their records and underpinning data with us. </p>\n<p>To paint a more detailed picture of the scholarly record, our priority is to get more and varied organisations contributing to the research nexus, rather than putting up barriers and blockers until they are performing perfectly. If they aren’t acting in the best interests of the scholarly community, then having the metadata available to assess will quickly make that obvious and hopefully encourage changes - sunlight being the best disinfectant, as the saying goes.</p>\n<p>As we said in the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/\">first ISR blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Crossref itself doesn’t assess the quality of content or the integrity of the research process but rather enables those who produce scholarly outputs to provide metadata (effectively evidence) about how they ensure the quality of content and how the outputs fit into the scholarly record.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In our next post in the series, we&rsquo;ll talk more about the workflow and decision-making tools we have in place and are planning to develop. We&rsquo;ll pose questions about what kinds of metadata give what kind of levels of trustworthiness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helping-new-members-become-good-crossref-citizens\">Helping new members become “good Crossref citizens”</h2>\n<p>Once an applicant becomes a member, we help them to completely fulfil the membership terms - ensuring that, for example, they register and display DOIs, keep their metadata up to date, and implement <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/reference-linking/\">reference linking</a> properly. </p>\n<p>We have <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/\">a lot of documentation</a> on our website, we run regular <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/events/\">events and webinars</a>, and we have a series of automated onboarding emails for new members to help them move through the key stages of the member journey from set up and onboarding to levelling up and using additional services like Crossmark and Similarity Check. Our staff are also on hand alongside Ambassadors and other members in our <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Community Forum</a>. Speaking of POSI (and transparent operations) we receive around 3,000 emails per month with support requests so we are gradually moving support from closed 1:1 email to the more public and efficient community support forum.</p>\n<p>We work with members who aren’t fulfilling the obligations to understand challenges and help explain what they need to do. This is currently reactive, but we have plans to automate checks on whether members are meeting the membership terms in future.</p>\n<p>Outside of confirming that our members are behaving as “good Crossref citizens”, there aren’t many other areas where the membership team typically gets involved. Our mission is to help preserve the integrity of the scholarly record by making the metadata provided by our members openly available in a machine-readable format. We don’t investigate our members’ business practices or take a deep dive into their editorial processes (such as peer review), and there are many areas where we aren’t able to get involved. For example, we cannot arbitrate title ownership disputes.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"its-all-about-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record\">It’s all about preserving the integrity of the scholarly record</h2>\n<p>We do sometimes revoke membership, but this is for limited reasons: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>unpaid invoices;</li>\n<li>legal sanctions or judgments against the member or its home country; or</li>\n<li>contravention of the membership terms.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"membership-revocation-due-to-unpaid-invoices\">Membership revocation due to unpaid invoices</h3>\n<p>We spend a lot of time communicating with members who haven’t paid their invoices and ensuring they have the information they need to solve the problem. Revoking membership due to unpaid fees is an absolute last step for us, but financial sustainability means we can keep the organisation afloat and keep our infrastructure running.</p>\n<p>Where members have unpaid fees, we eventually suspend their access to register new records and then ultimately revoke their membership if the fees remain unpaid. Once an organisation’s membership has been revoked, they would need to re-apply if they wanted to become a member again in the future. If accepted, the applicant would need to pay all outstanding invoices before re-joining. </p>\n<p>In March 2022, we revoked membership for around 140 members due to unpaid invoices (out of a total of over 17,000 active members).\n </p>\n<h3 id=\"membership-revocation-due-to-sanctions\">Membership revocation due to sanctions</h3>\n<p>Occasionally, we are informed of sanctions that we need to comply with, such as the recent case of Russia invading Ukraine where each Russian member needed to be checked for individual sanctions and some were revoked. Such revocations have to be voted on by the Executive Committee and then ratified by the board. Read more <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/sanctions/\">information on our sanctions process</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"membership-revocation-for-cause\">Membership revocation for cause</h3>\n<p>Very occasionally there may be evidence that a member is in contravention of the membership terms. This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Misrepresentation in the original membership application</li>\n<li>Fraudulent use of identifiers or metadata</li>\n<li>Contravening the code of conduct</li>\n<li>Any other basis set forth in our governing documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We always try to work together with the member to solve problems, and again, revoking membership is an absolute last step. The revocation has to be voted on by the Executive Committee and then ratified by the board. </p>\n<p>Our first ever revocation for cause was in July 2019 for OMICS, after the board voted that the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/152-3113-omics-group-inc\" target=\"_blank\">US Federal Trade Commission</a>&rsquo;s ruling against them amounted to a cause for revocation. There have been a handful of cases since. For example, most recently in September this year we revoked membership for a member who was registering DOIs for journals with the ISSNs of similarly-named publications.</p>\n<p>There’s more information about our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/revocation/\">processes to revoke membership</a> on our website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-participation-for-the-win\">More participation for the win</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, we believe that the more parties able to participate in Crossref and provide metadata and context for the research nexus, the more robust this makes the scholarly record.</p>\n<p>But do you agree? Are these measures enough? What other information about our membership operations would help us be more transparent? As we said in our first blog, we need your help to establish whether our approach is still the right one, if we are missing anything and what else we might be able to do.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Join the discussion about the integrity of the scholarly record on our community forum.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye out for future blog posts and meetings.

Every initiative and service that we have launched since our founding has been focused on documenting and clarifying the scholarly record in an open, machine-actionable and scalable form. All of this has been done to make it easier for the community to assess the trustworthiness of scholarly outputs. Now that the scholarly record itself has evolved beyond the published outputs at the end of the research process – to include both the elements of that process and its aftermath – preserving its integrity poses new challenges that we strive to meet&hellip; we are reaching out to the community to help inform these efforts.</p>\n<p>Scholarly research, and therefore scholarly communications, are rapidly changing with the development of new approaches, technologies, and models. We need <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H\" target=\"_blank\">open scholarly infrastructure</a> that can adapt to these changes and provide trust signals that enable assessment of the integrity of the research and reflect the ways that research is changing. Crossref has been changing and adapting by building on the concept of the scholarly record with our vision of the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/seeing-your-place-in-the-research-nexus/\">Research Nexus</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;a rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society&rdquo;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The foundation of the scholarly record and Research Nexus is metadata and relationships - the richer and more comprehensive the metadata and relationships in Crossref records, the more context there is for our members and for the whole scholarly research ecosystem. This will lead to a range of benefits from better discovery and saving researchers time to the assessment of research impact and research integrity. This is why Crossref is focused on enriching metadata to provide more and better trust signals while keeping barriers to membership and participation as low as possible to enable an inclusive scholarly record.</p>\n<p>We want to engage with the community to emphasise this role, share our plans for the future, and get feedback to establish if we are heading in the right direction.</p>\n<p>This blog explains our current position and will be followed by subsequent posts exploring all our services and plans in this area, as well as more details on our membership operations and policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record-isr-and-how-does-it-feed-into-research-integrity\">What is “Integrity of the Scholarly Record” (ISR), and how does it feed into Research Integrity?</h2>\n<p>The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/policy/research_integrity/what-is.htm\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> research integrity as a set of values in scientific research: honesty; accuracy; efficiency; and objectivity. It’s concerned with the <em>soundness of the process</em> of science. As a subset of that, the <em>outputs of the scholarly publishing process</em> create a “scholarly record” which allows those in the community to find evidence and context to help confirm whether these values have been adhered to. The scholarly record is Crossref’s focus. This means that Crossref itself doesn’t assess the quality of content or the integrity of the research process but rather enables those who produce scholarly outputs to provide metadata (effectively evidence) about how they ensure the quality of content and how the outputs fit into the scholarly record (through reference links, ORCID iDs for authors, ROR IDs for affiliations, funding and licensing information, etc.).</p>\n<p>Crossref members include any organisation that produces research objects and materials (publishers, societies, universities, funders, research institutions, scholars) so they can establish a persistent record—tied to a persistent and unique identifier—for these outputs and supply metadata about this content in an open, machine-readable way. Maintaining this record for the long term, and adding in an important layer of context, establishes the integrity of the scholarly record as well as ensuring it is something that can be used by the whole community to improve scholarly research for generations to come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-scholarly-record-is-about-more-than-just-published-outputs---its-also-a-network-of-inputs-relationships-and-contexts\">The scholarly record is about more than just published outputs - it’s also a network of inputs, relationships, and contexts</h2>\n<p>In the past, the Scholarly Record was seen as just the published outputs at the end of the research process - for example, journal articles or book chapters. But as the OCLC Research Group notes in their 2014 report on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.25333/C3763V\" target=\"_blank\">The Evolving Scholarly Record</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The boundaries of the scholarly record are in flux, as they stretch to extend over an ever-expanding range of materials.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OCLC describes how outputs at the “process” and “aftermath” stages of the research process are becoming increasingly important alongside the outputs at the traditional “outcomes” stage.</p>\n<p>We like to take this even further. We think the evolving Scholarly Record is about more than just recording different types of <em>works</em>. As the above report notes “<em>The scholarly record is evolving to have greater emphasis on collecting and curating context of scholarly inquiry […] One can imagine an article in quantitative biology published in a Wiley journal, the data for which resides in Dryad; the e-print in arXiv; and the conference poster in F1000. All of these materials may be considered part of the scholarly record, but no single institution will collect them all. Instead, access is achieved through a coordination of stewardship roles in which the scholarly record is decomposed into discrete, interrelated units that organisations specialize in collecting, preserving, and making available</em>.”</p>\n<p>It’s this <em>interrelatedness</em> that we think is important, and Crossref plays an important role in collecting, matching, and sharing those relationships. We now focus on this ‘nexus’ - so no longer primarily the different types of objects, but increasingly the interplay and relationships between them. The context, rather than the individual metadata elements, is what’s key.</p>\n<p>Martin Eve explores this idea further in his blog <a href=\"https://eve.gd/2022/07/26/what-is-the-scholarly-record/\" target=\"_blank\">What is the Scholarly Record</a>, suggesting “the scholarly record is a decentralized network of evolving truth assertions” and “Whether a truth assertion is part of the scholarly record is determined by another set of distributed assertions and their power configurations (say, through institutional affiliation) of the individuals who make such assertions.”</p>\n<p>Barbara Fister excellent <a href=\"https://barbarafister.net/libraries/lateral-reading-and-information-systems-in-the-age-of-distrust/\" target=\"_blank\">talk about the importance of lateral reading as a way to understand information systems</a> discusses how professional fact checkers “engaged in “lateral reading,” check other sources for context before spending time reading and analyzing a source.”</p>\n<p>Fister highlights the “SIFT” approach from <a href=\"https://barbarafister.net/libraries/lateral-reading-and-information-systems-in-the-age-of-distrust/\" target=\"_blank\">A Curriculum for Civic Online Reasoning</a>, created by a group of educators at Stanford University for students to evaluate online content. And she argues that this approach is also useful for assessing scholarly materials noting</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<em>The networked, social nature of scholarship is worth making explicit</em>”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"where-does-crossref-fit-in-where-do-we-have-the-most-impact-and-opportunity\">Where does Crossref fit in? Where do we have the most impact and opportunity?</h2>\n<p>To address the question of our role in the integrity of the scholarly record, we need to understand several aspects that Crossref has to balance in this capacity, such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don’t have the means or desire to be the arbiter of research quality. However, we operate neutrally, at the centre of scholarly communications, and we can help develop a shared consensus or framework. Our metadata elements and tools can be positioned to signal or detect trustworthiness. An important distinction is that we can play a role in assessing <em>legitimacy</em> but not in assessing <em>quality</em>.</li>\n<li>We must be cautious that our best practices for demonstrating legitimacy and handling less-than-legitimate behaviour do not raise already-high barriers for emerging publications or organisations that present in ways that some may not recognise as professional standards. Disruption is different from deception. In discussions with our board this point has come out strongly: that Crossref has an opportunity to think about how to help the community identify deceptive actions and pair that with our efforts to bring more people on board.</li>\n<li>Addressing this issue may involve changes to our membership eligibility and processes, bylaws, policies, staff resources, and technical and metadata solutions; actually, a combination of all these aspects. Many of these are projects that are already planned and we have ideas for extending these.</li>\n<li>We regularly review the process we use for evaluating when and why to revoke membership for reasons other than non-payment. The volume of cases that we believe justify membership revocation&mdash;while a tiny fraction of members&mdash;is growing and does take staff and legal resources to address.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"crossref-and-our-members-aleady-help-preserve-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record-in-significant-ways\">Crossref and our members aleady help preserve the integrity of the scholarly record in significant ways</h2>\n<p>Almost all of our services in some way touch on enabling people to express and evaluate trustworthiness; our mission statement commits us to “<em>making research objects easy to find, cite, link, <strong>assess</strong>, and reuse [&hellip;] all to help put research in context.</em>”</p>\n<p>We have, of course, specific tools and services that augment this activity too. Many members are active in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reporting corrections and retractions through <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/\">Crossmark</a> metadata.</li>\n<li>Assessing originality using <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/\">Similarity Check</a>.</li>\n<li>Conveying their stewardship via the public <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">participation report</a>.</li>\n<li>Establishing provenance and stakeholders through funding metadata, ORCID, and ROR.</li>\n<li>Acknowledging funding through the use of the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\">Open Funder Registry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/grants/\">registering grants metadata</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/data-citation/\">Citing data</a> for transparency and reproducibility, including linking to related research data via <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/event-data-now-with-added-references/\">Event Data</a>.</li>\n<li>Demonstrating open peer review by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/peer-reviews/\">registering peer review reports</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As recently concluded in this <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-02915-1\" target=\"_blank\">Nature editorial</a> calling for us to think beyond open references,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Depositing all relevant metadata in Crossref should become the norm in scholarly publishing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For those members just starting out on their journey, there are some immediate specific things that all members are able to do. Check your <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">participation report</a> and start registering more metadata to add that contextual layer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>References</li>\n<li>Abstracts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/6z7s3\" target=\"_blank\">Corrections and retractions via Crossmark</a></li>\n<li>License links</li>\n<li>ORCID IDs for authors</li>\n<li>ROR IDs for affiliations</li>\n<li>Grant IDs for funder acknowledgements</li>\n<li>Cite data (preferably using DataCite DOIs in reference lists)</li>\n<li>Register all related objects such as versions and translations via relationships</li>\n<li>Register grants with Crossref (funder members).</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By enabling our members to register their research objects and create metadata records about them that are freely and openly shared with the scholarly community, we facilitate them in being able to communicate the context and trustworthiness of that object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And within that metadata, they can create relationships not just between research objects and also between research stakeholders - the individuals, affiliations, funders, and other players involved. That’s why we work so closely with other parts of foundational scholarly infrastructure (ORCID, DataCite, ROR) and why we now have more than 30 funders registering grants with us. We want to help to capture, identify, and link together all these important elements and more to deliver context for the scholarly record.</p>\n<p>We started this blog by talking about the changes that are taking place in the world of research and how the infrastructure needs to adapt and change.

We don’t take such changes lightly, because we know it means updating established workflows. We appreciate the questions that prompted us to make this recommendation and we know it’s critical that we get community input on the proposed updates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2>\n<p>Here is a quick overview:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DOIs and URLs themselves don’t really tell readers much. People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to read out loud the contents of a page. We’re asking for the title of each DOI to be added, in an <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/\" target=\"_blank\">ARIA</a> (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attribute, so these users understand what these links are for.</li>\n<li>Accessible text, as this kind of description is known, should be included for all links, but at this time, we’re specifically recommending it for landing pages of newly registered records.</li>\n<li>It’s not required, yet. We’re proposing a 2 year recommendation period and we want your feedback on the particulars, including timing and how we can help. Please take a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/K6zWQ3f1dmYUkj9T6\" target=\"_blank\">short survey</a> and/or <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">get in touch</a> and share your thoughts.</li>\n<li>We’ll finalize these recommendations after assessing the feedback. Please check back for updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-changing-when-and-why\">What is changing, when and why</h2>\n<p>The proposed updates are meant to improve overall usability, particularly for people with visual impairments, by aligning our guidelines with modern accessibility requirements such as the new <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2021/09/UX-Guide-metadata-1.0/principles/\" target=\"_blank\">W3C recommendations</a> and the <a href=\"https://inclusivepublishing.org/blog/what-does-the-european-accessibility-act-mean-for-global-publishing/\" target=\"_blank\">European Accessibility Act</a>. This means that assistive technologies such as screen readers can interpret DOI links.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are changes being recommended?</strong></p>\n<p>DOIs are <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/member-setup/constructing-your-dois/#whyopaque\" target=\"_blank\">unique</a> and persistent links to items in the scholarly record so it makes sense that they link to the full URLs for the associated content –for example, a journal article. The issue for people who rely on screen readers is that a DOI link doesn’t provide title or other information to give that link context. Users of screen readers need to know what the destination of a link is.</p>\n<p>These users often lack the context that other users have; in fact, they may be presented with links in a document as a list. That&rsquo;s why all links, not just DOI links, need what is called &ldquo;accessible text.” Providing additional information for links requires <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/\" target=\"_blank\">ARIA</a> (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) techniques. This speaks to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the standard guidelines for accessibility across the web, specifically <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context\" target=\"_blank\">success criterion 2.4.4</a> - Link Purpose (In Context), which aims to ‘help users understand the purpose of each link so they can decide whether they want to follow the link.’</p>\n<p><strong>For your feedback: recommended draft changes</strong></p>\n<p>We recommend the addition of an <em>aria-label</em> attribute for DOI links, containing as its value the descriptive title of the content represented by the DOI, so that screen readers can interpret DOI links. This means that, <em>while the DOI display itself doesn’t actually change</em>, the link is enhanced with additional, contextual information for the user of assistive technology, in one of two ways, either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>an aria-label attribute</strong>, described as ‘a way to place a descriptive text label on an object,’ identifying the destination, or</li>\n<li><strong>an aria-describedby attribute</strong> pointing to where the destination is identified in the surrounding text.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The updated HTML for a journal article*, for example, would be:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678&quot; aria-label=&quot;DOI for Toward a Unified Theory of High-Energy Metaphysics: Silly String Theory&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Here the aria-label has been set to the value of the ‘title’ property as retrieved from the Crossref REST API at <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.5555/12345678\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.5555/12345678</a>.</p>\n<p>*Note that fields may vary slightly for different <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">content types</a>.</p>\n<p>This proposed solution allows screen readers to read aloud to users the value of the aria-label attribute, instead of the full DOI in the link text.</p>\n<p><em>At this time, we are recommending the change for landing pages in particular</em>, but it can and should be applied to wherever DOI links appear, whenever feasible (more on this below).</p>\n<p>Our guidelines will continue to state that the DOI should always be displayed as a full URL link&ndash;that will not change. Neither will <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/\">content registration</a>&ndash;we are not asking for additional information in your deposits.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s not perfect, but it’s very worthwhile</strong></p>\n<p>This recommendation has some limitations worth noting but it must be said that there is no perfect solution.</p>\n<p>DOI links appear in lots of places - PDFs for one notable example. We reviewed and tested the recommendation with Bill Kasdorf, Principal, Kasdorf &amp; Associates, LLC, Richard Orme, CEO, DAISY Consortium, and George Kerscher, Chief Innovations Officer, DAISY Consortium-Senior Officer, Global Literacy, Benetech, who graciously provided their time and expertise. EPUBs and websites proved to be easy to update; other formats, notably PDFs, less so. Widespread adoption of accessible DOIs is so important and we don’t want confusion or frustration to get in the way of making progress. We support and welcome efforts to include an ARIA attribute wherever DOI links appear, but we recommend focusing on landing pages, for now.</p>\n<p>Patrick Vale, Crossref Senior Front End Developer, explains that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”DOI links serve a very specific purpose: to provide the persistent link to an item in the scholarly record. And as such, they present an unusual set of requirements when balancing accurately presenting the information they encode - the persistent link - and making that link accessible, and understandable. With these proposed changes, we hope to strike this balance.“</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We know it will be a challenge (more on that below) but we think it’s absolutely a worthwhile effort. Indeed, we are undertaking a project to update our own website to meet these recommendations and to review overall accessibility.</p>\n<p>As Bill Kasdorf notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Most people have no idea how many people with visual impairments there are. Not only is it unfair to those people not to provide accessible text for links, the authors and publishers of the linked resource are missing a lot of readers. This update is a great move by Crossref, and every bit aligned with its mission to make scholarly content discoverable and consumable.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>We propose the following timeline, also for your feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Once finalized, following community feedback, the updated guidelines will be issued as a recommendation for a suggested period of two years starting next year, 2023. Beginning in 2025, the changes will be required for landing pages of newly registered content (and strongly recommended for existing registered content). Feedback on this approach and timeline is also encouraged.</p>\n<h2 id=\"help-us-help-you\">Help us help you</h2>\n<p>We are conscious that adding descriptive information to DOI links places a significant responsibility on the members and Service Providers creating and hosting these links. Therefore, we are also considering the creation of a tool to help with implementation. Initial discussions suggest this could be a JavaScript helper tool, which could be included on member websites. We also welcome feedback as to how such a tool might be implemented, and how it would best integrate with existing sites and workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"call-for-comments---by-1st-november\">Call for comments - by 1st November</h2>\n<p>We hope that this proposal is a welcome one and that the timing is good for moving forward together toward greater accessibility of the scholarly record.\n<strong>We welcome questions, feedback and suggestions through 1st November via the <a href=\"https://forms.gle/7diHy46Cu5J52q417\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> below or by email to <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">feedback@crossref.org</a></strong></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqLWIycofCUbGXxZRcOjkDM43zsIsfLdO2ZqhVVHiwDQUSeQ/viewform\" width=\"760\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" >Loading...</iframe>\n<h2 id=\"small-changes-big-impact\">Small changes, big impact</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to make changes that improve accessibility and we look forward to the community’s response to our proposal.

No wonder that reports of metadata errors from authors, members, and other metadata users are some of the most common messages we receive into the technical support team (we <a href=\"https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">encourage</a> you to continue to report these metadata errors).</p>\n<p>We make members’ metadata openly available via our APIs, which means people and machines can incorporate it into their research tools and services - thus, we all want it to be accurate. Manuscript tracking services, search services, bibliographic management software, library systems, author profiling tools, specialist subject databases, scholarly sharing networks - all of these (<a href=\"https://metadata2020.org/learn-more/stakeholders/\" target=\"_blank\">and more</a>) incorporate scholarly metadata into their software and services. They use our APIs to help them get the most complete, up-to-date set of metadata from all of our publisher members. And of course, members themselves are able to use our free APIs too (and often do; our members account for the vast majority of overall metadata usage).</p>\n<figure><img src='https://www.crossref.org/images/documentation/metadata-users-uses.png' alt='Metadata users and uses: metadata from Crossref APIs is used for a variety of purposes by many tools and services' title='' width='75%'></figure>\n<p>We know many organizations use Crossref metadata. We highlighted several different examples in our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/api-case-study/\" target=\"_blank\">API case study blog series</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/user-stories/\" target=\"_blank\">user stories</a>.

When we receive reports of metadata quality inaccuracies, we review the claims and work to connect metadata users with our members to investigate and then correct those inaccuracies.</p>\n<p>Thus, while Crossref does not update, edit, or correct publisher-provided metadata <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/with-a-little-help-from-your-crossref-friends-better-metadata/\" target=\"_blank\">directly</a>, we do work to enrich and improve the scholarly record, a goal we’re always striving for.

Especially journal articles. But, many members may not know what the page range of the content will be when they register the content with us (perhaps the content in question is an ahead-of-print journal article and the member intends to update this page range later). The issue here is that page range is an important piece of the metadata that we use for citation matching. If the pagination registered with us is incorrect, and it differs from the pagination stated in the citation, our matching process is challenged. Thus, we might fail to establish a citation link between the two works. The page range beginning with page 1 is the most common pagination error that the technical support team sees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More metadata does not mean better metadata.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"other-pagination-errors\">Other pagination errors</h3>\n<h4 id=\"in-the-xml-registered-1\">In the XML registered</h4>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-XMLSchema\" data-lang=\"XMLSchema\">&lt;item_number item_number_type=&#34;article-number&#34;&gt;1&lt;/item_number&gt;\n</code></pre><h4 id=\"more-on-the-problem-1\">More on the problem</h4>\n<p>Like first pages beginning with 1, few internal article numbers are 1.

That said, if you, as a member, don’t use internal article numbers or other metadata elements that can be registered, a recommendation we’d make is: <strong>if you don’t know what the metadata element is, omit it</strong>.

The incorrect metadata limits our ability to establish relationships between works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-go-from-here\">Where to go from here?</h2>\n<p>One thing we’ve said throughout this blog that we’ll reiterate here is: accurate metadata is important. It’s important in itself, and the metadata registered with us is heavily used by many systems and services, so think Crossref and beyond. In addition to that expanding perspective, there are practical steps members and metadata users can take to help us:</p>\n<p>As a member registering metadata with us:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>make sure we have a current metadata quality contact for your account and update us if there’s a change</li>\n<li>if you receive an email request from us to investigate a potential metadata error, help us</li>\n<li>if you do not know what to enter into a metadata element or helper tool field, please leave it blank; perhaps some of the examples of errors within this blog were placeholders that the responsible members intended to come back to - to correct in time; that’s also a practice to avoid</li>\n<li>if you find a record in need of an update, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/maintaining-your-metadata/updating-your-metadata/\" target=\"_blank\">update it</a> - updates to existing records are always free (we do this to encourage updates and the resulting accurate, rich metadata, so take advantage of it).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a metadata user:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>if you spot a metadata record that doesn’t seem right, let us know with an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support@crossref.org</a> and/or report it to the member responsible for maintaining the metadata record (if you have a good contact there)</li>\n<li>if you’re eager to confirm the last update of a metadata record, our REST API is a great resource; here’s a handy query to use as a starting point: this one returns records on our Crossref prefix 10.5555 that have been updated in 2022: <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.5555/works?rows=500&amp;filter=from-update-date:2022-01-01,until-pub-date:2022-12-31&amp;mailto=support@crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.5555/works?rows=500&filter=from-update-date:2022-01-01,until-pub-date:2022-12-31&mailto=support@crossref.org</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Making connections between research objects is critical, and inaccurate metadata complicates that process. We’re continually working to better understand this, too. That’s why we’re currently researching <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/rfp-help-evaluate-the-reach-and-effects-of-metadata/\" target=\"_blank\">the reach and effects of metadata</a>.

I&rsquo;ve had the same conversation many times: I tell someone (only if they ask!) that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M66K5R\" target=\"_blank\">my dissertation</a> was a history of the villanelle, and then they cheerfully admit that they don&rsquo;t know what a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanelle\" target=\"_blank\">villanelle</a> is, and then I ask them if they&rsquo;re familiar with Dylan Thomas&rsquo;s poem <a href=\"https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Do not go gentle into that good night.&rdquo;</a> So far, everyone has heard of it &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very well-known poem indeed. I then explain that &ldquo;Do not go gentle into that good night&rdquo; is a villanelle, and that a villanelle is a poetic form something like a sonnet. So far, everyone also knows what a sonnet is, which is why I use that as a comparison, even though a villanelle isn&rsquo;t all that much like a sonnet, in my opinion. They&rsquo;re both poetic forms, however, with a particular standard number of lines and a particular standard rhyme scheme, so in that sense they certainly are alike.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, I think my early background in the study of poetic form is very much of a piece with my new role here at Crossref as <a href=\"https://ror.org/blog/2022-06-13-welcome-amanda-french/\" target=\"_blank\">Technical Community Manager for ROR, the Research Organization Registry</a>. Both poetic form and metadata are invisible to most people, but both are valuable infrastructure. Both poetic form and metadata involve generally-accepted practices and standards that differ between different groups of people and change over time. Both writing formal poetry and creating rich metadata can seem burdensome and rigid to some people, but to my mind, both are generative. A solid underlying foundation allows for all kinds of creativity to flourish on the surface.</p>\n<p>That might be part of why as soon as I heard about ROR I understood its tremendous potential. As someone who&rsquo;s worked in digital humanities and scholarly communication for over fifteen years, I&rsquo;ve long appreciated the value of clean, standard, comprehensive metadata in general. For instance, I explained the origin and value of the <a href=\"https://www.dublincore.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Dublin Core metadata standard</a> to many a history scholar in the <a href=\"https://omeka.org\" target=\"_blank\">Omeka</a> workshops I often taught at <a href=\"https://thatcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\">THATCamp</a>. Later, while overseeing the <a href=\"https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu\" target=\"_blank\">institutional repository at Virginia Tech University Libraries</a>, I learned even more about both the importance and the difficulty of creating, acquiring, and providing good metadata. When the pandemic began in 2020, I <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/why-its-hard-to-count-recovered\" target=\"_blank\">learned more than I ever wanted to know about messy data</a> as Community Lead for <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com\" target=\"_blank\">The COVID Tracking Project at <em>The Atlantic</em>.</a></p>\n<p>Data and metadata are, let&rsquo;s admit it, very hard to keep clean and consistent as they travel through multiple systems, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to regularize as much as we can through automatic means such as APIs that use agreed-upon standards. Scholarship is a network of networks, and common identifiers like DOIs and ORCIDs enable the interchange of information in those networks about scholarly outputs and scholars, and thus they enable scholarship itself. What could be more important than that?</p>\n<p>But the organizations that employ, fund, and publish scholarly researchers have had a hard time keeping track of everything &ldquo;their&rdquo; researchers have given to the world. That&rsquo;s the problem that ROR, <strong><a href=\"https://ror.org\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;a community-led registry of open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifiers for every research organization in the world,&rdquo;</a></strong> can help solve. In an ideal world, universities might use ROR IDs to track the research their faculty have produced, certainly, but they might also discover which universities their faculty&rsquo;s co-authors most often come from. Funders might use ROR IDs to identify the research outputs that have benefited from their funds, certainly, but they might also analyze whether they are funding enough researchers from institutions in rural areas. Publishers might use ROR IDs to offer affiliation searching in their own public interfaces, certainly, but they might also create internal reports on compliance with institution-level transformative Open Access agreements. Once something like ROR is widely adopted, the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus\">vision of the Research Nexus</a> becomes closer to reality: &ldquo;A rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society.&rdquo; ROR is all about the &ldquo;organizations&rdquo; part of that alluring vision.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re curious about ROR and want to learn more (hey, that rhymes!), you might want to watch the highly informative presentation from September 2021 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Mtqb64OEk\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Working with ROR as a Crossref Member&rdquo;</a>, in which you&rsquo;ll learn several interesting things, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ROR itself is not an organization, but an initiative supported jointly by Crossref, DataCite, and the California Digital Library;</li>\n<li>Crossref members cited institutional affiliation identifiers as one of their top priorities in 2019, second only to abstracts;</li>\n<li>The specifics of how one recent ROR integrator, the open access journal publisher <a href=\"https://hindawi.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hindawi</a>, used the ROR API to create a typeahead widget in its manuscript submission system that replaces user-supplied free text with a standard institution name and a ROR ID behind the scenes, helping them to generate useful internal reports about institutional payments; and</li>\n<li>Crossref supports the submission of ROR IDs in its XML content registration process and makes ROR IDs <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-ror-some-update-to-our-api/\" target=\"_blank\">available in its API</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also enthusiastically inviting you to <a href=\"mailto:afrench@crossref.org\">get in touch with me</a> if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about ROR or if you&rsquo;d like to tell me about your previous experience with ROR.

Much of scientific production and communication these days has a heavy digital footprint so the Nexus is nothing but simply connecting the loose strands, right? Yet, as the scholarly record is a reflection of the continuous progress made by multiple actors within the context of scientific structures and processes, bringing the Nexus to life is a little short of simple.</p>\n<p>“<em>What we think of as metadata is expanding, and the notion of ‘content types’ is changing</em>” – said Ginny Hendricks. A great majority of scholarly ‘objects’, whether they are data sets, research articles, monographs, or others, undergo many processes (including review, publication, licensing, correction, derivation) and influence knowledge and practice over time.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2022/research--nexus-2021.png\"\nalt=\"visualizing the Research Nexus vision\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>Making that progress visible and discoverable will allow for tracing the development of ideas and changes in our thinking over time. Transparency of the complete scholarly records will help to understand the impact of science funding and changing policies. It can support a more robust and comprehensive assessment of research, and contribute to improving integrity within as well as public trust in sciences.</p>\n<p>The Research Nexus concept was first introduced by Jennifer Lin in 2017 as “<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-research-nexus-better-research-through-better-metadata/\">Better research through better metadata</a>”. Important adaptations to the model were needed to break it out of the content-specific schema. Ginny also pointed out that the concept is shared among the scholarly infrastructure community, citing a report from 2015 by OCLC Research on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.25333/C3J63N\" target=\"_blank\">conscious coordination for stewardship of the evolving scholarly record</a>.</p>\n<p>Patricia Feeney has given us reasons for optimism in building a robust Nexus. She’s shown areas of greatest growth in metadata reported to Crossref and shared <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/JaB7xxgw/crossref-metadata\" target=\"_blank\">a public roadmap</a> of types of information we’re asked to enable in the future. We’re seeing a true boom of datasets and peer review reports registrations, and the relationship metadata for our records is improving too. At <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/amendments-to-membership-terms-to-open-reference-distribution-and-include-uk-jurisdiction/\">the dawn of defaulting to open references</a>, 44% of records we hold have associated references and that is growing. Provision of the newly enabled affiliation information (ROR IDs) is on the rise, as is the funder information. Some conversations and questions followed highlighting the need for further guidance in these areas.</p>\n<p>To make a case for enriching metadata records, Martyn Rittman demonstrated examples of traceability of research influence on realities outside academia. He captured recent examples of data citations and other references present not just between scholarly papers, but also in policy documents and popular media. These allow for greater discoverability of literature – but also show the public influence and impact of the research and the work’s context in our wider society.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2022/slide-policy-docs.png\"\nalt=\"expanding what the Research Nexus covers\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</figure>\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile Martyn shared our blue-skies aspiration to streamline Crossref’s APIs to offer insight to all these relationships with a single service, Joe Wass grounded those ambitions in the reality of technical work underway. His team’s attention is divided between three main areas. They continue to maintain and de-bug our existing infrastructure. They are developing self-service solutions for members. Finally, they are mapping and planning improved infrastructure, evaluating technology against the Research Nexus vision.</p>\n<p>Bringing it back to the source (of metadata), Rachael Lammey offered a very practical guide to key activities enabling Research Nexus that all members can take on now. She highlighted the benefits of collecting and registering data citations, ROR IDs, and grant funding information. She went on to talk about challenges of subject classification (at a journal level) that our research and development efforts are focusing on at the moment.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2022/research-nexus-do-now.png\"\nalt=\"What Crossref members can do to build the Research Nexus\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"summary-of-discussions\">Summary of discussions</h3>\n<p>Publishing has changed dramatically and our members recognise increasing opportunities for transparency of the scholarly record. Breaking the distant vision of Research Nexus down into actionable chunks made it more relatable for call participants. Many reflected on seeing their place in it properly for the first time. Yet, challenges remain and many were brought to the fore in the discussions.</p>\n<p>The reliability and usability of the technology for registering metadata with Crossref needs to improve. We need to do better in supporting multi-language and multi-alphabet information. Not just developing systems anew, but also streamline the way content is registered and annotated, and continue to disambiguate the competing identifiers. Different content types, chiefly books, present specific challenges in this regard. Finally, making all that metadata accessible and usable is key to enabling insights from the rich data we collectively make available.</p>\n<p>Technology is important, but won’t overcome the barriers that exist in the mindsets. Siloed thinking means that publishers may not be sensitive to benefits that improved relationship metadata could have for colleagues working on assessment, even within the same institutions. Greater guidance or best practices for new identifiers, such as ORCID, ROR, grants, would allow more publishers to get on board with the changes. Researchers often don’t help the cause either – many don’t realise the role and benefits of metadata for their work and are reluctant to provide rich information related to it, perceiving it as a bureaucratic burden.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, I learnt that – while the concept of Research Nexus is pretty complex – we’re all already participating in making it a reality. I’m grateful to the call participants for sharing their challenges and ideas so generously. It means we can work to address those. I’ll be sure to follow-up on requests for support and clearer guidelines about citing data, recording ROR IDs and grants information in the metadata, and we’ll engage our community on complex topics of record updates (corrections, retractions and versions). Be sure to keep in touch with the conversations on the <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Community Forum</a>.

That was when Rachael Lammey joined the R&amp;D team as the Head of Strategic Initiatives.</p>\n<p>And now, with <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/announcing-our-new-director-of-product-rachael-lammey/\">Rachael assuming the role of Product Director</a>, I&rsquo;m delighted to announce that <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/dominika-tkaczyk/\" target=\"_blank\">Dominika Tkaczyk</a> has agreed to take over Rachael&rsquo;s role as the Head of Strategic Initiatives. Of course, you might already know her.</p>\n<p>We will also immediately start recruiting for a new Principal R&amp;D Developer to work with Esha and Dominika on the R&amp;D team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-rd\">What does this mean for R&amp;D?</h2>\n<p>Before I talk about what Dominika&rsquo;s move means in practice, I just want to take a moment to thank Rachael for the time she spent working with us. Over the past year, she has injected a massive amount of energy into the group and rebuilt the team&rsquo;s momentum. This is exactly what we asked her to do.</p>\n<p>Rachael&rsquo;s first task was to repatriate her two R&amp;D colleagues, who we had loaned to work on other urgent projects. Dominika was the technical lead on the port and relaunching of the REST API. Esha was the technical lead for the ROR initiative. In addition, Rachael has been working with Esha, Dominika, Paul Davis, and me on several shorter-term strategic projects that are shaping our overall development strategy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring and implementing a new approach to building content registration front ends. This approach is schema-driven and bakes in localization and accessibility support from the start. The new approach is currently the basis for the grant registration tool that our Product &amp; Tech teams are now testing with our new funder members.</li>\n<li>Exploring and ultimately rejecting a &ldquo;pull-based&rdquo; approach to registering metadata, where Crossref would harvest structured metadata from member landing pages instead of asking members to deposit it with us via XML. You are not really doing R&amp;D unless some of your ideas fail. In this case, we quickly discovered that the logistics of crawling our members’ websites, combined with the sparsity of structured metadata in landing pages, made a pull-based approach fragile and impractical.</li>\n<li>Exploring the use of ML techniques to fill gaps in the journal classification data that is currently in the REST API. Gaining new data science badges in the process.</li>\n<li>Exploring alternative approaches to building community-extendable reporting tools using standard data science tooling and techniques.</li>\n<li>Exploring how we can help reduce support toil by using data science tools like notebooks to create new support tools and self-serve UIs for information frequently requested by members that can otherwise prove difficult to get using our existing tools.</li>\n<li>Looking at extending the matching technology previously developed by labs to try and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/follow-the-money-or-how-to-link-grants-to-research-outputs/\" target=\"_blank\">better match funder grant-information research outputs</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this is just a sample of projects Rachael helped promote and prioritize. It is the nature of many of the larger R&amp;D projects that you don&rsquo;t see the immediate results until long after they&rsquo;ve been conceived and put into motion. This means that Rachael has been working on some things over the past year that are not yet public.</p>\n<p>But, with any luck, we may see some significant new developments in how Crossref collects and distributes information about significant updates to the scholarly record- including retractions and withdrawals. We are also likely to see more work to promote data citation amongst our members. And finally, we are likely to see an attempt to create a community-managed and open research classification taxonomy. Of course, as is the case with research projects, there is no guarantee that any of these nascent ideas/projects will make it into a production service. Still, if even one of them does, it will become as vital a part of open scholarly infrastructure as DOIs, ORCIDs, or ROR IDs are now.</p>\n<p>And we will have Rachael and the hard work of the R&amp;D group, important cameos from others, and community input to thank for giving them the initial push to realization. So that&rsquo;s a pretty good track record for just a year in the R&amp;D group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"passing-the-torch\">Passing the torch</h2>\n<p>And this is a track record I&rsquo;m confident that Dominika can match as she takes over Rachael&rsquo;s role.</p>\n<p>Soon after Dominika joined the Crossref R&amp;D team, she started to expand her activities to include more production engineering practice, team leadership, and community outreach. She has also worked extensively with support and outreach- providing them with data science consulting and mentoring in software development. Her new role as the Head of Strategic Initiatives will continue this trend. She will spend less time prototyping software and analyzing data and more time liaising with our members and the broader community to understand their needs and design R&amp;D projects to test approaches to meeting those needs. This means a lot more liaising with other Crossref teams, speaking with our members and the wider community, and participating in working groups and conferences.</p>\n<p>It also probably means a lot less programming and analysis. But programming and building prototypes are critical to the R&amp;D team.

This changed drastically in March 2020, when we had to stop traveling and stop having in-person meetings and events. Due to the hard work and creativity of our team and the support of our Ambassadors and Sponsors, we were able to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/community-outreach-in-2020/\">move to exclusively online meetings and events</a> and maintain connections with colleagues, members, and much of the scholarly research community.</p>\n<p>Online meetings have benefits compared to in-person ones; they have a much lower carbon footprint, and they can be more inclusive because people don’t have to find the time and money to travel. But there are limitations to online meetings; individual connections made in person do become harder to maintain, and new connections are more difficult to make and grow online. Sometimes just by sitting with someone, meeting their team and drinking their tea, free-flowing conversation leads to real progress.</p>\n<p>But with over 17,000 members in 150 countries, our small staff can’t be everywhere, and we need to consider the personal as well as the environmental impacts.</p>\n<p>When we started work on the 2022 budget last year, our staff and board took the opportunity to think about our approach, with the goal of not going back to ‘normal’. So we asked ourselves, now that we have a better sense of what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, how can we make our travel and in-person meetings have a greater impact on our goals, while also traveling less and reducing our impact on the environment?</p>\n<p>We decided that in the context of our mission and values, we had to take into account three key areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The environment and climate change</li>\n<li>Inclusion</li>\n<li>Work/life balance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We developed an updated strategy for in-person and online meetings from 2022 onwards along with a set of recommendations and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. The commitments were approved by the board at its November 2021 meeting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-plan-for-online-and-in-person-meetings\">Our plan for online and in-person meetings</h2>\n<p>Online events will generally be aimed at broad groups, in multiple timezones, to inform, update, and test general ideas and assumptions at scale. In contrast, in-person events will be smaller, focusing on deep learning, co-creation, and collaborating through various formats such as workshops, roundtables, or sprints, ideally working toward a specific outcome. These smaller in-person meetings will be scheduled alongside other community events so there will be fewer trips on the whole but each trip more consolidated.</p>\n<p>Each in-person meeting will have stated goals such as recruiting and onboarding a new Sponsor, bringing our Ambassadors together to build relationships and share best practices, or getting experts together in a room to help decide important polices, improve some code, or plan new initiatives. At the moment, we are not planning &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; events as we don&rsquo;t believe they will help meet our goals.</p>\n<p>While online meetings and webinars provide a <em>breadth</em> of interactions, in-person meetings can provide greater <em>depth</em> and opportunities for more meaningful engagement and purposeful discussion, and it is this depth that we have missed over the last two and a half years. Therefore, we are identifying focus countries where we plan on engaging more with local community groups. Each country-level engagement plan includes outreach and communications activities and some in-person meetings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"factors-and-aims-for-selecting-focus-countries\">Factors and aims for selecting focus countries</h3>\n<p>Inclusion is important for us and we are committed to supporting the needs of our community members worldwide. We aim to combine meaningful conversations with informational activities. We want to provide time in the day for technical problem solving and/or a more strategically focused session, both of which have worked well in the past. We hope to learn more about trends in our selected focus countries, including the challenges our members face, local publishing norms, barriers to participation in Crossref, and understand and help to adapt government policies.</p>\n<p>We consider a number of factors when selecting countries with which to focus our activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where we have a relatively large number of members.</li>\n<li>Where we are seeing an increase in new members joining.</li>\n<li>Where we have not undertaken engagement activities in at least 3 years.</li>\n<li>Where we have good contacts to collaborate with, i.e., a national funder, a sponsor or ambassador, a government body, or another organization aligned with our mission.</li>\n<li>Where we have very few members but where research output is high according to other sources, in order to understand and overcome barriers to participating in Crossref.</li>\n<li>Where we can consolidate multiple engagement activities in one trip, for example run a LIVE (informational) meeting or workshop, develop relationships with a key Sponsor, or discuss national research policy with government representatives.</li>\n<li>Where we can coordinate our engagement efforts alongside other local community events.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"our-environmental-commitments\">Our environmental commitments</h2>\n<p>In line with rethinking how we engage with our members and making sure we do so in the most sustainable, inclusive, and impactful way, we are making the following commitments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Crossref staff will think strategically and consider environmental, inclusion, and work/life balance issues when they plan travel. We will make the most of in-person events by focusing on those that involve interaction, such as listening and learning from our members and users, deepening relationships, co-creating, and forming new alliances</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will travel less and have fewer face-to-face meetings going forward compared with 2019 as a baseline year. The 2022 travel and events budget was reduced by 40% and set at 60% of the 2019 budget. Travel and in-person events for the first half of 2022 have been limited so we will make this same commitment for 2023 still using 2019 as the baseline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Crossref will track the carbon footprint of staff travel to meetings and events. We will regularly review the data and find ways to reduce the environmental impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combine stakeholder visits with event trips and vice versa whenever possible (if you do 1 plane trip to a location 1000 miles away instead of 2 trips, you reduce your impact by 0.5t)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As previously planned before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Crossref LIVE Annual Meetings will remain online only and will be held in different time zones. Having them in different time zones will enable global sharing of updates with a lower environmental impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Crossref board meetings will be reduced from three in-person meetings per year to one face-to-face and two online meetings per year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fewer staff will attend fewer in-person conferences and will combine them with other travel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For Crossref staff meetings, it is important for our distributed staff to meet face-to-face as a whole organization and as teams. We will plan for one all-staff in person meeting per year (at which there can also be team meetings). Additional team meetings will be based on the reduced travel and meetings budget. Where possible, team meetings will be combined with other meetings (e.g. conferences or other community events).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While trips that combine meetings may mean longer time away from home, we will still try to avoid staff having to travel or be away on weekends. We will also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid short-haul flights (under 2.5 to 3 hours) where trains are available.</li>\n<li>Book hotels within walking distance of the event locations (if safe) in order to reduce taxi use.</li>\n<li>Use public transport and trains (if efficient and safe).</li>\n<li>Select hotels that have good sustainability plans in place, seeking out ‘green’ hotels where (if available and within budget).</li>\n<li>Prioritize locations where the fewest number of staff have to travel or travel the shortest distances.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"reporting\">Reporting</h3>\n<p>From now on, we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Track staff travel incl. the number of trips, miles flown, and the carbon impact.</li>\n<li>Estimate the carbon footprint of our two offices, staff home working, our data center, and our cloud infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Track all Crossref-hosted events - in-person and online and review annually (what went well, what can be improved, how to further reduce carbon footprint) as part of the budgeting process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many organizations are now rethinking how to go about travel, conferences, meetings, and work in general. The pandemic may have been the trigger for a big shift in the ways we work and interact, and not all of it was welcome or should continue; however, sometimes it takes a big event to give us the space to sit back, reflect, and change things for the better going forward. As always, we&rsquo;ll evaluate these approaches over time.</p>\n<p>All of this means we may be declining some in-person meetings (and when we do, please don’t take it personally) but we still look forward to engaging with our community in a purposeful way.</p>\n<p>This feels like a good time to give a shout-out to all our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/our-ambassadors/\">Ambassadors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/about-sponsors/\">Sponsors</a> around the world who are very important for insight and engagement, and we will continue to partner with them for both online and in-person meetings.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Annual call for board nominations","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/annual-call-for-board-nominations/","published":"Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000","description":"The Crossref Nominating Committee is inviting expressions of interest to join the Board of Directors of Crossref for the term starting in March 2023.

Crossref’s board helps shape the future of our services, and by extension, impacts the broader scholarly ecosystem. We are looking for board members to contribute their experience and perspective.</p>\n<p>The role of the board at Crossref is to provide strategic and financial oversight of the organization, as well as guidance to the Executive Director and the staff leadership team, with the key responsibilities being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting the strategic direction for the organization;</li>\n<li>Providing financial oversight; and</li>\n<li>Approving new policies and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The board is representative of our membership base and guides the staff leadership team on trends affecting scholarly communications. The board sets strategic directions for the organization while also providing oversight into policy changes and implementation. Board members have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure sound operations. Board members do this by attending board meetings, as well as joining more specific board committees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-expected-of-board-members\">What is expected of board members?</h3>\n<p>Board members attend three meetings each year that typically take place in March, July, and November. Meetings have taken place in a variety of international locations and travel support is provided when needed. Following travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, the board adopted a plan to convene at least one of the board meetings virtually each year and all committee meetings take place virtually. Most board members sit on at least one Crossref committee. Care is taken to accommodate the wide range of timezones in which our board members live.</p>\n<p>While individuals apply to join the board, the seat that is elected to the board ultimately belongs to the member organization. The primary board member also names an alternate who may attend meetings in the event that the primary board member is unable to. There is no personal financial obligation to sit on the board.

We now have over 16,000 members across 140 countries. As we work to understand what’s to come and ensure that we are meeting the needs of such an expansive community, having trusted local contacts we can work closely with is key to ensuring we are more proactive in engaging with new audiences and supporting existing members.</p>\n<p>We know that Crossref still remains inaccessible to many around the world, and in line with our strategic goal to engage communities, we want to lower the barriers to participation. Our Ambassadors are essential to us achieving this goal as we look to develop additional content in languages other than English, identify organizations to work closer with to support local research ecosystems, provide more in-person and online events in local time zones and languages, and do more in terms of open support via our community forum.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2022/Crossref_AmbsdrsLogo_RGB.png\"\nalt=\"Ambassadors program logo\" width=\"350\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-our-ambassadors-up-to-now\">What are our ambassadors up to now?</h2>\n<p>We currently have a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/our-ambassadors/\" target=\"_blank\">team</a> of 30 ambassadors, spanning Indonesia, Turkey, Ukraine, India, Bangladesh, Colombia, Mexico, Tanzania, Cameroon, Nigeria, Russia, Brazil, USA, UAE, Australia, China, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, and Taiwan. The program is reviewed annually, welcoming new faces and sometimes sadly saying goodbye to others. This enables us to continue improving how we work together and ensures the Ambassador team remains a diverse group of committed individuals that have the time and support from Crossref to fully participate in the program.</p>\n<p>Over the last 3 years, we’ve had some great successes alongside a few challenges, not least of which has been working across 15 countries during a pandemic. We have all experienced the additional personal and professional strain that COVID-19 brought along, including shifts in the way we work and anxieties in the way we go about our lives. Of course, it has also meant that all our interactions have been restricted to Zoom, which has many benefits but doesn’t compare to face-to-face interactions when it comes to building strong working relationships, particularly across language and cultural barriers.</p>\n<p>Despite this, our ambassador team helped us run 15 multi-lingual webinars last year, including Content Registration in Arabic, Getting Started with Books in Brazilian Portuguese, and an Introduction to Crossref in Chinese. They also helped us translate various materials and content into other languages, provided feedback on our new developments, took part in beta-testing, provided support to members on our community forum, and participated in calls to contribute to the program&rsquo;s future.</p>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I love helping people get to know Crossref&rsquo;s products and services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was proud to work as Ambassador and give an online Chinese webinar to introduce Crossref and the services in Oct. 2021.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am glad to be of help to Spanish speakers who are not able to grasp all the Crossref information correctly because of a language barrier or because they don&rsquo;t have the time to read and explore all the information available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Muy contento de poder formar parte como Embajador y con ello poder promover el uso y aprovechamiento de los productos de Crossref.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I feel so blessed meeting with many diverse friends in Crossref ranging from Europe to Asia continents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Feeling happy by giving back knowledge to my regional community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-is-ours-to-co-create\">The future is ours to co-create</h2>\n<p>As countries are slowly dropping restrictions and we are taking our first cautious steps into a potential ‘post-pandemic’ world, our Community Engagement and Communication team has been looking at what this means for our activities in 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<p>A big part of this is identifying local communities and groups to engage with to learn what challenges our members are facing, what barriers to participation in Crossref still exist, and how we can overcome these together. This practice is also fundamental to our vision of the Research Nexus––a rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions––which can only become a reality if everyone can fully contribute to the scholarly record.</p>\n<p>As such, we would like to expand our Ambassador Program and particularly encourage applications from those based in the following countries:</p>\n<div class='shortcode-row '>\n<div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-first-para-highlight\"><p>Argentina<br>\nChile<br>\nCanada<br>\nCroatia<br>\nEl Salvador<br>\nGermany<br>\nGhana</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-first-para-highlight\"><p>Iraq<br>\nKenya<br>\nNicaragua<br>\nNigeria<br>\nPeru<br>\nPoland<br>\nVietnam</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>By being one of our ambassadors, you will become a key part of the Crossref community; our first port of call for updates or to test out new products or services, become well connected to our wide network of members, and work closely with us to make scholarly communications better for all.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in participating, please read more on our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/ambassadors/\">Ambassadors page</a>. You can submit an <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/ambassadors/#apply-to-become-an-ambassador\">application</a> letting us know why you are interested, how you work with Crossref currently, and a bit more about yourself. We will then follow up with you to discuss your ideas and the program in more detail.</p>\n<p>The Ambassador Program is quite flexible, so you can choose how and when you contribute based on your comfort levels and other commitments. However, it does come with some minimum requirements of attending two team calls a year, being responsive and letting us know if anything is preventing you from participating, and completing our annual feedback survey so we can continue to improve the program going forward.\nA good level of English and a firm understanding of our services and systems at Crossref is also a must to participate fully in the program and provide support to others in your local community. If you have just joined Crossref or want to learn more about how to work with us, then the Ambassador program may be too much for you right now, but our documentation has lots of helpful information and step-by-step guides, and you could also look at attending one of our events or joining our community forum.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, you can always contact us at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">feedback@crossref.org</a>.

Prior to the 2017 change, we acted as a broker of 1:1 feeds of parts of metadata for parts of our community - clearly a role that was not scalable.</p>\n<p>We are well underway to pay back technical debt on our 20-year-old metadata system and effectively rearchitect it. We therefore recently needed to decide whether to rewrite code for a capability that hardly any member was using. Just one member has chosen Closed, and Limited was the default for a while, but the vast majority of our members now prefer Open distribution. Additionally, bringing references in line with other metadata significantly simplifies this work and will speed up the technical development.</p>\n<p>The Crossref Board discussed the issue in our meeting on 10th March 2022, and voted to remove the reference distribution policy set in 2017. <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#motions\">All board motions</a> go on our website, and the wording of this particular motion is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Resolve that, based on a technical assessment, we will change the reference distribution policy so that all references registered with Crossref are treated the same as other metadata, following a planned transition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This motion means that 60 days from today&mdash;3rd June 2022&mdash;all references in Crossref will be open and after that available through our API. As with all other metadata, if members cannot make references available, or do not want them openly distributed, they can choose not to deposit them. However, depositing references is necessary in order to retrieve citation links from our members-only Cited-by API.</p>\n<p>Check the documentation for information on how to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/content-registration/descriptive-metadata/references/\">deposit references</a> and use <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/cited-by/\">Cited-by</a>.

These laws supersede our own governing bylaws.</p>\n<p>We have launched a new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability\">operations and sustainability</a> section of our website, which includes <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/sanctions/\">a sanctions page</a> which we will keep updated with any changes and actions we&rsquo;re taking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-specific-terms-that-will-change\">The specific terms that will change</h2>\n<p>The complete membership terms are <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/terms/\">online here</a>.

Metadata and Identifiers may also be licensed to third party subscribers along with an agreement for Crossref to provide third parties with certain higher levels of support and service. <del>For the avoidance of doubt, the scope of Crossref&rsquo;s distribution (if any) of a Member&rsquo;s references is based on such Member&rsquo;s reference distribution preference, as established by the Member in accordance with the &ldquo;Reference Distribution&rdquo; page on the Website.</del></p>\n<p><strong>20.

One reason we don’t is because members can and often do change their records (important note: updated records do not incur fees!). However, we do a fair amount of behind the scenes work to check and report on the metadata as well as to add context and relationships. As a result, some of what you see in the metadata (and some of what you don’t) is facilitated, added or updated by Crossref.</p>\n<p>Much of the work is automated but some of it still requires manual intervention (sound familiar?). Here’s an overview:</p>\n<h2 id=\"before-registration\">Before registration</h2>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/\" target=\"_blank\">open APIs</a> allow for Crossref metadata to be used throughout research and scholarly communications systems and services, before and after records are registered with us. Those who have used a search function in something like a manuscript submission system, rather than having to hand key or copy and paste the information, will appreciate how these integrations reduce time, effort and the likelihood of errors in collecting metadata well before it gets to Crossref.</p>\n<p>For one example, it’s very common for members to use the metadata to add DOIs to reference lists when preparing deposits. Of course, new members first need a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/member-setup/constructing-your-dois/\" target=\"_blank\">prefix</a> (and a memberID and name, but more on that later) in order to register content. We also provide a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/member-setup/constructing-your-dois/suggested-doi-registration-workflow-including-suffix-generator/\" target=\"_blank\">suffix generator</a> for help in <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/member-setup/constructing-your-dois/\" target=\"_blank\">constructing DOIs</a>. If you’re not sure how best to make use of existing metadata in deposits, we’ve got <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/\" target=\"_blank\">a few options</a> for you. Questions are welcome.</p>\n<p>We don’t often put it this way but we should: Crossref members rely on the metadata as much, if not more, than the rest of the community. More and better metadata directly benefits our members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upon-registration\">Upon registration</h2>\n<p>There are a number of ways we work with the metadata when deposits are received.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Checking for uniqueness</strong> In order to avoid duplicate records, we check to make sure that a title or work hasn&rsquo;t been registered before. Depending on what we find, a conflict report or failed registration may result.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding DOIs to references</strong> When references come to us without DOIs, we’ll try to match and add them.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/orcid/\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID auto-update</a></strong> We automatically update authors’ ORCID records (with their permission of course) whenever deposits include their ORCID iDs.</li>\n<li><strong>Preprint to VoR reports</strong> We compare title information and provide <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/content-registration/content-type-markup-guide/posted-content-includes-preprints/#00094\" target=\"_blank\">notifications</a> of matching records to members depositing preprints, to help them fulfill their obligation to link to Versions of Record (VoRs), where they exist.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/content-registration/structural-metadata/relationships/\" target=\"_blank\">Relationships</a></strong> Like preprint to VoR links, components are another kind of relationship. These might be supplementary material such as figures we can link to the ‘parent’ record.</li>\n<li><strong>Funding data</strong> When members register only a funder name as part of the information on who funded the work, we’ll try to match it to its identifier from the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\" target=\"_blank\">Funder Registry</a>, to support better linking between funders and works.</li>\n<li><strong>Timestamps</strong> We add date-times for first created and last updated to member-supplied timestamps.</li>\n<li><strong>Count of references</strong> That’s right, we count all the references for each record that includes them and add the total to the metadata.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"after-registration\">After registration</h2>\n<p>Once registered, we check, report on and update metadata in a few ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reports/doi-crawler-report/\" target=\"_blank\">Link checking</a></strong> We email each member a monthly Resolution Report with details of the number of failed and successful resolutions for their DOIs. If someone in the community reports a DOI that isn’t registered, we email the member a DOI Error Report.</li>\n<li><strong>Citation counts and matches</strong> Citation counts for records of members participating in our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/\" target=\"_blank\">Cited-by service</a> are openly available in our REST API. The matching citations themselves are available to members, for their own records only.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/before-during-and-after-a-journey-through-title-transfers/\" target=\"_blank\">Title transfers</a></strong> Title, prefix and DOI transfers are common and require assistance from our team.</li>\n<li><strong>MemberID</strong> It’s not uncommon for members to have more than one prefix. The memberID means users of the REST API can query for records associated with all of a member’s prefixes.</li>\n<li><strong>Digital preservation</strong> We handle the infrequent but critical update of URLs that are necessary when titles are triggered for digital preservation. We also preserve the metadata itself, with both <a href=\"https://clockss.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CLOCKSS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.portico.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Portico</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, since records are often redeposited with updates (note, deposit fees are only charged once per record), some of these processes on our side are repeated as necessary.</p>\n<p>This list isn’t exhaustive and other needs and opportunities will emerge. For example, we are looking at matching to add <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/some-rip-roring-news-for-affiliation-metadata/\" target=\"_blank\">ROR</a> IDs, as we do for funderIDs, and doing some research into how we might determine and assert subject classifications at the work-level.

We strive to provide quality editorial services that meet standard industry requirements and best practices, increase visibility, attract readers and potential authors, and ensure their work is properly cited. My personal goal is to be recognized by the scientific community for providing excellent service to our clients.</p>\n<p>Sou sócia proprietária da empresa Linceu Editorial, que se dedica à editoração de artigos científicos de inúmeras revistas, de forma ética, criativa e inovadora. Buscamos atribuir aos periódicos de nosso portfólio os requisitos de qualidade editorial alinhados às melhores práticas editoriais, de forma que aumentem sua visibilidade e atraiam leitores, potenciais autores e, não menos importante, que recebam citações em seus artigos. Meu objetivo pessoal é obter reconhecimento da comunidade científica por meio de uma prestação de serviço em nível de excelência.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is one thing that others should know about your country and its research activity?<br>\nO que os outros deveriam saber sobre seu país e sua atividade de pesquisa?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Brazil is the South American leader in publishing scientific articles in Open Access journals. However, it faces challenges due to the absence of a more comprehensive public policy to support scientific editors. As a result, most journals are produced by teaching and/or research institutions or scientific associations with volunteer editorial teams that, although lacking professional journal production skills, produce high-quality journals. Only a tiny percentage of Brazilian journals are published through commercial publishers.</p>\n<p>O Brasil é o líder sul-americano na publicação de artigos científicos, com destaque para as revistas em acesso aberto. No entanto, enfrenta desafios em função da ausência de uma política pública mais abrangente para apoio aos editores científicos. A maior parte dos periódicos é produzida por instituições de ensino/pesquisa ou Sociedades Científicas, tendo uma equipe editorial voluntária e carecendo de profissionalização em sua produção, embora, em muitos casos, apresentem boa qualidade. Apenas uma pequena porcentagem de periódicos brasileiros é publicada por meio de um publisher comercial.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are there trends in scholarly communications that are unique to your part of the world?<br>\nExistem tendências nas comunicações acadêmicas que são únicas em sua parte do mundo?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say unique. However, adherence to Open Science practices, such as preprints and making research data available, is already part of the editorial culture. On the other hand, open peer review is not yet well accepted by everyone in the scientific community, and only a few journals adopt it. In addition, in some areas of research, such as Education and Social Science, researchers are very active - on forums, in discussions lists and attending the same conferences - so there’s this feeling that ‘everyone knows everyone’ which can then lead to potential conflicts of interest and apprehensiveness around open peer review, particularly when it comes to publishing a negative review.</p>\n<p>Eu não diria única, mas penso que, no Brasil, a adesão às práticas da ciência aberta, como publicação em preprint e disponibilização de dados de pesquisa, já fazem parte da cultura editorial. Por outro lado, a revisão aberta ainda não é bem aceita por toda comunidade científica, sendo poucos os periódicos que o adotam. Além disso, em algumas áreas de conhecimento com grande produção local, como por exemplo a Ciências Sociais e Educação, a interação entre membros da comunidade é muito grande, visto que são pesquisadores muito ativos em fóruns, listas de discussões e conferências da área, causando a sensação de que &ldquo;todo mundo conhece todo mundo&rdquo;, resultando em um possível conflito de interesse, visto que existe um grande receio em publicar um parecer aberto, especialmente se o caso for um parecer negativo.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What about any political policies, challenges, or mandates that you have to consider in your work?<br>\nE as políticas, desafios ou mandatos políticos que você deve considerar em seu trabalho?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Latin America we have a large indexing database, Redalyc, and a digital library of Open Access journals, which has recently excluded a number of journals for charging APCs (Article Processing Charges), upon the understanding that this would go against their Diamond Open Access requirement.</p>\n<p>However, in Brazil - in general - the understanding of Open Access is not so limited. Charging APCs are in fact encouraged by many as a form of self-sustainability of the journal while still being Open Access.</p>\n<p>As for challenges, one of the biggest is whether or not to publish in English. Although the number of Brazilian journals that publish exclusively in English or both languages (Portuguese and English) is remarkably high. There is still however a belief that local science is only of interest to the local public, and so some question whether there is a value in publishing in English (or other languages). For example, if an author writes a research paper about a small riverside community in the countryside of Acre state in Brazil, they might ask why someone outside the country would be interested in reading that.</p>\n<p>Aqui na América Latina, temos uma grande base indexadora, Redalyc, e biblioteca digital de periódicos de Acesso Aberto que, recentemente, excluíu da base um número considerável de periódicos que cobrassem qualquer tipo de taxa de publicação, por entender que isso iria contra os requisitos de seu modelo de Acesso Aberto Diamante (periódicos em acesso aberto livre de taxa de publicação).</p>\n<p>No entanto, no Brasil, em geral, o entendimento é outro, a cobrança de taxas de processamento não descaracteriza o acesso aberto, sendo, na verdade, encorajado por muitos como uma forma de auto-sustentabilidade do periódico.</p>\n<p>Já em relação a desafios, acredito que um dos maiores é a questão de publicar ou não em inglês. Embora seja notável o número de periódicos brasileiros que publicam exclusivamente em inglês ou ainda nos dois idiomas (português e inglês), existe ainda a crença de que a ciência local só teria interesse do público local, criando assim o questionamento se há ou não o valor em publicar em outro idioma. Por exemplo, se uma pesquisa estuda algo sobre uma comunidade ribeirinha no interior do estado do Acre, aqui no Brasil, é comum existir a dúvida se algo tão específico seria do interesse de alguém de fora do nosso país.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How would you describe the value of being part of the Crossref community; what impact has your participation had on your goals?<br>\nComo você descreveria o valor de fazer parte da comunidade Crossref; que impacto teve sua participação em seus objetivos?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I get immense value from being part of the Crossref community. Being a Crossref Ambassador brings greater recognition and legitimacy to my role working with editors and adds value to my company’s services as well. The title of Ambassador enhances trust in my opinions, presentations, and when providing support and clarification to those asking questions. However it also comes with a great responsibility to do this well, which motivates me to always keep up to date with developments at Crossref. Through the Ambassador Program I have given several webinars for Crossref and the Associação Brasileira de Editores Científicos (ABEC Brasil), which provide much needed information and support to Portuguese speaking Crossref members as well as enhancing the visibility of my professional activities at Linceu Editorial.</p>\n<p>É um valor enorme fazer parte da comunidade Crossref! Ser Embaixadora do Crossref traz um reconhecimento entre os editores e agrega valor aos serviços de minha empresa. Esse título assegura confiabilidade em minhas opiniões, apresentações, e esclarecimentos de dúvidas, o que traz junto uma grande responsabilidade que me motiva a me manter sempre atualizada com tudo em relação ao Crossref. Através do Programa de Embaixadores eu ministrei diversos webinários para a Crossref e também para a Associação Brasileira de Editores Científicos (ABEC Brasil), fornecendo muitas informações necessárias para os membros da Crossref que falam português, e também isso tudo acaba por retornar em visibilidade para as minhas atividades profissionais na Linceu Editorial.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For you, what would be the most important thing Crossref could change (do more of/do better in)?<br>\nPara você, qual seria a coisa mais importante que o Crossref poderia mudar (fazer mais/fazer melhor)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think there is still a need for more multilingual training both online and face-to-face, which has been particularly lacking during the pandemic, to provide more information on Crossref services beyond Content Registration. For example Similarity Check is a service that people still have a lot of questions about (such as ‘what is the magic similarity percentage score to identify plagiarism?’ Answer - there isn’t one!). Crossmark is another service where I believe people could benefit from more training on it’s importance in the publication process, not only in cases of retraction but also in guaranteeing that the article is up-to-date and trustworthy. In Brazil many people use Open Journal Systems (OJS) and so the development of Crossref service specific plugins and training on how to use them is really useful!</p>\n<p>Acho que ainda há necessidade de mais treinamentos multilíngues, tanto online quanto presencial – o que tem sido particularmente escasso durante a pandemia – para fornecer mais informações sobre os serviços do Crossref além do Registro de Conteúdo. Por exemplo, o Similarity Check é um serviço sobre o qual as pessoas ainda têm muitas dúvidas (como &lsquo;qual é a porcentagem de similaridade aceitável para identificar plágio?&rsquo; Resposta - não existe!). O Crossmark é outro serviço onde acredito que as pessoas poderiam se beneficiar de mais treinamento sobre sua importância no processo de publicação, não apenas em casos de retratação, mas também para garantir que o artigo esteja sempre atualizado e confiável. No Brasil muitas pessoas usam o Open Journal Systems (OJS) e por isso o desenvolvimento de plugins específicos do serviço Crossref e treinamento sobre como usá-los seriam muito úteis!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Which other organizations do you collaborate with or are pivotal to your work in open science?<br>\nCom quais outras organizações você colabora ou é fundamental para o seu trabalho em ciência aberta?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I contribute to ABEC Brasil in a variety of ways including speaking on short courses about Crossref, designing content for lectures as part of an online program called ABEC Educação (which will be launched soon), and as a volunteer consultant to answer a variety of questions from editors regarding content registration at Crossref.</p>\n<p>Contribuo com a ABEC Brasil, participando tanto como ministrante de minicursos sobre ferramentas Crossref quanto como conteudista de um curso no Programa EaD ABEC Educação (que será lançado em breve), além de como consultora voluntária para atender a diversas dúvidas de editores em relação a depósito de conteúdo.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What are the post-pandemic challenges you are facing and how are you adapting to them?<br>\nQuais são os desafios pós-pandemia que você está enfrentando e como você está se adaptando a eles?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Considering the current situation in Brazil, I don’t think I would consider us having reached ‘post-pandemic’ just yet. Although vaccination is taking place successfully, there are still many uncertainties and fears. A good example of this is Crossref LIVE Brazil which was canceled at the start of the pandemic and at the moment we still don’t know when we will be able to reschedule this. It still feels too risky to bring a number of speakers from abroad to Brazil and too soon to hold such a large in-person event.</p>\n<p>However, if I had to highlight one challenge I&rsquo;ve been facing, it would be something more personal rather than work-related. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, it would be the lack of human contact! It has been really hard to get use to not gathering together with family and friends and not being able to travel, meet new people, and experience new cultures. To deal with it, I spend my free time planning the places I will go to and people I will visit as soon as this whole situation is over!</p>\n<p>Para ser honesta, considerando a realidade atual no Brasil, eu ainda não considero o momento atual &ldquo;pós-pandemia&rdquo;. Embora a vacinação esteja ocorrendo com sucesso, ainda existem muitas incertezas e medos. Um exemplo bem claro é o Crossref Live in Brazil, que foi cancelado assim que a pandemia foi &ldquo;anunciada&rdquo; e, até hoje, não sabemos quando ocorrerá, pois ainda soa muito arriscado trazer palestrantes de fora para o Brasil e também se encontrar com diversas pessoas em um evento presencial.</p>\n<p>No entanto, se eu tivesse que destacar um desafio que tenho enfrentado, seria algo mais pessoal e não relacionado ao trabalho. E, sem sombras de dúvidas, seria a falta de contato humano! Está sendo realmente complicado se acostumar em não encontrar amigos e familiares, e também não poder viajar e conhecer novos lugares, pessoas e culturas – o jeito que encontrei para lidar com isso é gastar meu tempo livre planejando todos os lugares que irei e todas as pessoas que visitarei assim que essa situação toda passar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What are your plans for the future?<br>\nQuais são seus planos para o futuro?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My plans for the future include continuously learning more and more about scholarly publishing including the various services that Crossref provides. I want to be able to help publishers implement valuable tools into their workflows such as Similarity Check and Crossmark, and contribute to greater scientific dissemination of Brazilian research so that Brazilian journals can get the global recognition, visibility and value they deserve.</p>\n<p>Meus planos para o futuro incluem aprender cada vez mais e mais sobre publicação científica, incluindo os vários serviços que o Crossref oferece. Quero poder ajudar os editores a implementar ferramentas valiosas em seus fluxos de trabalho, como Similarity Check e Crossmark, e contribuir para uma maior divulgação científica das pesquisas brasileiras para que os periódicos brasileiros possam obter o reconhecimento global, visibilidade e valor que merecem.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Bruna!<br>\nObrigado, Bruna!</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Outage of March 24, 2022","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/outage-of-march-24-2022/","published":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000","description":"So here I am, apologizing again.

We apologise for this.</p>\n<p>Like the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/update-on-the-outage-of-october-6-2021/\">outage last October</a>, the issue was related to the data center that we are trying to leave. However, unlike last time, our single nearby network admin wasn&rsquo;t in surgery at the time. Tim was alerted in the early hours of his morning and was able get up and immediately investigate.</p>\n<p>Despite having both secondary and tertiary backup connections, neither activated appropriately.</p>\n<p>The problem was with incomplete BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) settings on our primary connection&rsquo;s network provider’s side. We never noticed this because our backup connection had the correct and complete BGP settings. But our backup circuit went down (we don’t know why yet), and when the router with complete settings went down, only the router with the incomplete settings was available and so everything went down.</p>\n<p>We hadn’t yet fully configured the tertiary connection to cut over automatically. This meant cutting over to the tertiary during the outage would have required manual and potentially error-prone reconfiguration. Not something we wanted to do in a hurry with a sleep-deprived network admin.</p>\n<p>It’s not an excuse at all. But we are currently down two people in our infrastructure group. One of our infrastructure staff recently left for a startup, and we are already hiring a new third position. In short, our one-long-suffering sysadmin had to field this all by himself. But hey - <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/jobs/2022-03-15-head-of-infrastructure/\">we are hiring a Head of Infrastructure</a>, and if you are interested you can now see the work you&rsquo;d have cut out for you!</p>\n<p>So things are back up and we’ve resolved the incident but we are carefully and cautiously monitoring. We will further analyze what went wrong and post an update when we have a clearer picture.</p>\n<p>I apologize for the downstream pain this outage will have inevitably caused. We realize that many people will now be scrambling to clean things up after this lengthy outage.</p>\n<p>More when I have it… but for now I&rsquo;ll mostly be curled up in a ball.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Announcing the ROR Sustaining Supporters program","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/announcing-the-ror-sustaining-supporters-program/","published":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000","description":"In collaboration with California Digital Library and DataCite, Crossref guides the operations of the Research Organization Registry (ROR).

ROR is community-driven and has an independent sustainability plan involving grants, donations, and in-kind support from our staff.</p>\n<p>ROR is a vital component of the Research Nexus, our vision of a fully connected open research ecosystem. It helps people identify, connect, and analyze the affiliations of those contributing to, producing, and publishing all kinds of research objects. Crossref added support for ROR to its schema and REST API in 2021 and we are <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/some-rip-roring-news-for-affiliation-metadata/\">asking Crossref members</a> to use ROR IDs for author affiliations in the metadata they deposit with Crossref. But this post is about how the Crossref community can support ROR in another way.</p>\n<p>All three lead organizations&mdash;as well as the ROR initiative&mdash;have publicly committed to the <a href=\"http://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/\" target=\"_blank\">POSI Principles</a> and we know that our diverse and global community is increasingly interested in showing its support for open scholarly infrastructure too. Now there&rsquo;s an opportunity to show that support; the following blog by Maria Gould, cross-posted from the <a href=\"https://ror.org/blog/2022-02-28-help-sustain-ror/\" target=\"_blank\">ROR blog</a>, explains how.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"ror-begins-a-new-round-of-community-fundraising\">ROR begins a new round of community fundraising</h2>\n<p>Since ROR launched in 2019, we have been charting a path to sustainability that leverages our broad community network and diversifies our funding sources. ROR is currently funded through a combination of in-kind support from its three operating organizations, project-based grant funds, and financial contributions from community members.</p>\n<p>While ROR aims to minimize overhead and contain costs, it still requires resources to build and maintain the registry&rsquo;s infrastructure, especially as adoption continues to grow. ROR has been working to establish independent revenue streams that complement ROR&rsquo;s in-kind support, avoid dependence on grant funds, and ensure the registry data remains openly available.</p>\n<p>This year, ROR is initiating a new round of community fundraising. Building on the <a href=\"https://ror.org/blog/2019-10-16-help-sustain-ror\" target=\"_blank\">community fundraising campaign</a> we ran during 2019-2021, we are renewing a call for organizations to commit to supporting ROR financially. We are launching a Sustaining Supporters program that opens up new ways for organizations to participate in the collective funding of ROR.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ror-sustaining-supporters-program\">ROR Sustaining Supporters program</h2>\n<p>With the Sustaining Supporters program, organizations are encouraged to support ROR&rsquo;s operating expenses on a recurring annual basis. Any organization that signs up to support ROR through the end of 2022 will be recognized as a Founding Supporter and receive a supporter badge that can be displayed on their website.</p>\n<p>We want to make the process of contributing to ROR as easy as possible. To ensure this is the case, organizations can support ROR at any amount that works for their budget and capacity. Also, to simplify the invoicing process, organizations that are already members of <a href=\"https://crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a> or <a href=\"https://datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite</a> can choose to receive an invoice directly from Crossref and DataCite for their ROR contributions. However, if organizations prefer, they can also be invoiced directly from ROR.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-support-ror\">Why support ROR</h2>\n<p>ROR aims to be an example of the power and potential of community-funded open infrastructure. ROR is committed to providing open, stakeholder-governed infrastructure for research organization identifiers and associated metadata. Implementation of ROR IDs in scholarly infrastructure and metadata enables more efficient discovery and tracking of research outputs across institutions and funding bodies.</p>\n<p>The Sustaining Supporters program is the next step in ROR&rsquo;s sustainability journey. ROR is continuing to explore future potential paid service tiers designed for those organizations and companies that rely heavily on our infrastructure, which would complement the supporters program. However, rest assured that any paid services will not impact the availability of ROR data or our commitment to supporting our community, in line with our commitment to the <a href=\"https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen key infrastructure components disappear, be enclosed, or get acquired. We are also realistic about how much effort and cost is involved in sustaining key components of open infrastructure that the scholarly community depends on. And we are committed to doing this right. That means not just sustaining core infrastructures, but investing in them so that they can evolve alongside community needs.</p>\n<p>ROR is a free resource for the research community. However, this shared infrastructure does require a collective funding approach that can sustain it as a common good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-us\">Join us!</h2>\n<p>This is an exciting moment to be part of ROR&rsquo;s growth.

Those relationships are absolutely essential: an item without them is missing the most basic context about its structure, origin, and impact.</p>\n<p>No wonder that finding and exposing relationships between items in the scientific ecosystem is considered very important by virtually all parties involved. Probably the most famous instance of this problem is finding citation links between research outputs. Another, relatively new example, is linking research outputs with grants used as their funding source.</p>\n<p>At Crossref, for some time now we have been seeing a steady growth of funder membership and grant registration. We are aware that the possibility of finding relationships between grants and research outputs is a big reason why funders are registering grants with us in the first place. Being able to see which research outputs are being supported by which grants helps reduce the reporting burden on researchers, funders, and institutions alike, especially now with the addition of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-ror-some-update-to-our-api/\">ROR IDs</a> to help complete the picture. Exposing relationships between research outputs and grants also increases the transparency of funding sources of the research, making it easier to assess and trust scientific findings.</p>\n<p>But how can we find those relationships and how many of them can we already observe? Thankfully our REST API, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/come-and-get-your-grant-metadata/\">recently equipped with the grant metadata</a>, can help us answer these questions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-perfect-scenario\">The perfect scenario</h2>\n<p>Imagine a world where the metadata of any scientific output states all relationships with other items existing in the scientific ecosystem, and those related items are always referred to by their persistent identifiers, allowing all this information to be accessed in a fully machine-readable way&hellip; Lovely, right?</p>\n<p>In the case of citations, in such a perfect world every bibliographic reference has a DOI of the cited item. And in the case of funding information, a scientific paper contains grant DOIs, stating the funded-by relationships between the paper and the grants.</p>\n<p>But, as the last two years have painfully taught us all, life is not all rainbows and unicorns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-reality-kicks-in\">The reality kicks in</h2>\n<p>We know that around <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/what-if-i-told-you-that-bibliographic-references-can-be-structured/\">71% of bibliographic references are deposited with Crossref without a DOI of the cited item</a>. This means that if we want to establish citation links between items, we need to match the bibliographic references using the provided metadata, which is not a trivial task and can potentially introduce errors.</p>\n<p>And the situation with the funding information and grant DOIs is even worse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"problem-1-our-schema-does-not-allow-the-publishers-to-attach-grant-dois-to-research-outputs\">Problem #1: our schema does not allow the publishers to attach grant DOIs to research outputs</h3>\n<p>This issue is 100% on us. Because grant DOIs are relatively new, our deposit schema does not yet allow to specify the grant DOI in the funding information of a research output, even if the publisher wanted to. We are working on changing this.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, it looks like persistent identifiers always find a way. Within over 7.4 million research outputs with funding information, we noticed 6 cases where a grant DOI was provided as an award number. For example in <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1093/nar/gkaa994\" target=\"_blank\">10.1093/nar/gkaa994 </a>we have the following:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>funder: [\n{\nname: &#34;Wellcome Trust&#34;,\naward: [&#34;10.35802/108758&#34;],\ndoi-asserted-by: &#34;publisher&#34;,\nDOI: &#34;10.13039/100010269&#34;\n}, ...\n]\n</code></pre><p>This may not be 100% correct from the schema perspective, but it is very useful when one is interested in linking grants to research outputs!</p>\n<p>But those cases are extremely rare outliers. For the vast majority of the outputs, grant DOIs are not present in the metadata. This means that, just like in the case of bibliographic references, we have to use the metadata to match funding information to grants.</p>\n<p>Funding information is typically given as a pair: award number, funder information. Grants contain similar metadata. One might be tempted to use only the award number for linking, as in some cases it can look like a grant identifier.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s consider an example. We want to find all papers funded by grant <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.37807/gbmf7622\" target=\"_blank\">10.37807/gbmf7622</a>. The award number is <code>GBMF7622</code>. A simple approach might be to search for items with this award number in Crossref&rsquo;s REST API, which returns 12 results<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. However, one of the resulting items is the grant itself<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>. So excluding that, it seems like there are 12-1=11 research outputs funded by this grant.</p>\n<p>Simple and easy, right? Well, think again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"problem-2-award-numbers-are-not-unique\">Problem #2: award numbers are not unique</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another example grant: <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.46936/10.25585/60000600\" target=\"_blank\">10.25585/60000600</a>. Its award number is <code>2817</code> and the funder is the <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/100000015\" target=\"_blank\">US Department of Energy</a>.</p>\n<p>When we search for this award we get 10 results<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>. Like before, one of them is our grant. After examining the remaining 9 we will see that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 items have been funded by the <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/100015911\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Genome Institute</a>, which according to the Funder Registry has been incorporated into <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/100006151\" target=\"_blank\">Basic Energy Sciences</a>, which is a descendant of the <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/100000015\" target=\"_blank\">US Department of Energy</a></li>\n<li>2 items have been funded by <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/100001819\" target=\"_blank\">International Rett Syndrome Foundation</a> from the US</li>\n<li>2 items have been funded by <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/501100003074\" target=\"_blank\">Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</a> from Argentina</li>\n<li>1 item has been funded by <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/501100007113\" target=\"_blank\">Arak University of Medical Sciences</a> from Iran</li>\n<li>1 item has been funded by <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/501100004883\" target=\"_blank\">Shahrekord University</a> also from Iran</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So among only 9 items mentioning the same award number we have in fact 5 different grants. Our input grant should probably be linked only to the three items mentioning Joint Genome Institute. The main problem illustrated here is that the award numbers are not globally unique, and thus should not be treated like identifiers.</p>\n<p>Indeed, within 38,326 grants registered so far, we have 37,608 distinct award numbers, and among those, there are 716 award numbers, each of which appears in multiple grants. This issue comes in two flavours: conflicts between and within funders.</p>\n<h4 id=\"between-funder-award-number-conflicts\">Between-funder award number conflicts</h4>\n<p>A conflict between funders is when more than one funder uses the same award number for one of their grants. This is expected - award numbers are assigned by funders internally and are not designed to be a globally unique identifier.</p>\n<p>Out of 716 award numbers that appear in multiple grants, 12 are numbers that appear in grants of different funders. For example, there are two grants with the award number <code>105626</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.48050/pc.gr.10753\" target=\"_blank\">Systemic MFG-E8 Blockade as Melanoma Therapy</a> funded by Melanoma Research Alliance</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.35802/105626\" target=\"_blank\">Institutional Strategic Support Fund Phase2 FY2014/16</a> funded by Wellcome Trust</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of those conflicts, we cannot simply rely on the award numbers for linking grants to research outputs. Instead, we have to use more information to be sure that the links are correctly established.</p>\n<h4 id=\"within-funder-award-number-conflicts\">Within-funder award number conflicts</h4>\n<p>To our big surprise, it turns out that the majority of the award number conflicts happen not between different funders, but within the grants of a single funder. Out of 716 award numbers that appear in multiple grants, 704 appear in multiple grants of a single funder only. Such situations are not expected and could indicate an error or some other systematic issue with the data.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, out of those 704 award numbers, 700 are associated with the US Department of Energy. We&rsquo;ve followed up with them in order to clarify or resolve this. The US Department of Energy pointed out a fundamental issue with the data model: currently a grant deposited with Crossref has to have at least one funder DOI, and no other way of identifying the associated organisation is allowed. At the same time, some of the facilities that should appear in their grants&rsquo; metadata are not funders at all and thus cannot be identified by a funder DOI. In the future, they plan to identify those facilities in their grant metadata by providing ROR IDs.</p>\n<p>Because of within-funder award number conflicts, in some cases it might be difficult to distinguish between two grants with the same award number and funder. A solution might be to use additional information or simply not accept any links if a research output cannot be reliably linked to one grant only.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-linking-approach\">Our linking approach</h2>\n<p>Based on all those observations, we adopted the following approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We iterated over all registered grants, for each we performed the following steps:\n<ul>\n<li>We used <code>award.number:&lt;grant DOI&gt;</code> filter in the REST API to find all items listing a given grant&rsquo;s DOI as the award number. Because this is based on the grant&rsquo;s persistent identifier, we recorded those links without any further verification.</li>\n<li>We used the <code>award.number:&lt;grant award number&gt;</code> filter in the REST API to find all items listing grant&rsquo;s award number in the funding information. Each resulting item was then verified by comparing the funder information in the item to the funder information in the grant. We recorded the link between the grant and the candidate item only if the verification succeeded.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the final step, we examined all recorded links to make sure that each pair (research output, award number) is linked to at most one grant. Links violating this rule were flagged as not reliable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We used different techniques to verify the funder information between the research output (item) and the grant, depending on what information is available. Grants always have the funder DOI. The item, however, can have the funder DOI, the funder name, or both.</p>\n<p>If the funder DOI was available on both sides, the following rules were used for the funder verification (ordered by decreasing confidence):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both the item and the grant contain the same funder DOI, for example, <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.35802/089928\" target=\"_blank\">10.35802/089928</a> and <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1242/jcs.196758\" target=\"_blank\">10.1242/jcs.196758</a></li>\n<li>The funder in the item replaced or was replaced by the funder in the grant (according to the Funder Registry), for example, <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.35802/104848\" target=\"_blank\">10.35802/104848</a> and <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1136/medethics-2020-106821\" target=\"_blank\">10.1136/medethics-2020-106821</a></li>\n<li>The funder in the paper is an ancestor or a descendant of the funder in the grant (according to the Funder Registry), for example, <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.46936/sthm.proj.2010.40084/60004575\" target=\"_blank\">10.46936/sthm.proj.2010.40084/60004575</a> and <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00629\" target=\"_blank\">10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00629</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the funder DOI was not available in the item, the following rules were used for the funder verification (ordered by decreasing confidence):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The funder name in the paper is the same (ignoring the case) as the funder name in the grant, for example, <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.35802/110166\" target=\"_blank\">10.35802/110166</a> and <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.14645.4\" target=\"_blank\">10.12688/wellcomeopenres.14645.4</a></li>\n<li>The funder name in the item is the same (ignoring the case) as the name of the funder that replaced/was replaced by the funder in the grant, for example, <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.35802/206194\" target=\"_blank\">10.35802/206194</a> and <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1172/jci.insight.96381\" target=\"_blank\">10.1172/jci.insight.96381</a></li>\n<li>The funder name in the item is the same (ignoring the case) as the name of the ancestor/descendant of the funder in the grant, for example, <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.46936/cpbl.proj.2001.2191/60002922\" target=\"_blank\">10.46936/cpbl.proj.2001.2191/60002922</a> and <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1109/tkde.2016.2628180\" target=\"_blank\">10.1109/tkde.2016.2628180</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this is in fact very similar to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/matchmaker-matchmaker-make-me-a-match/\">our reference matching approach</a>. In both cases, first we search for candidate items, and then verify the candidates by comparing the metadata. The actual metadata used for the verification varies, because different information is typically given in the bibliographic reference and the funding information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-we-found\">What we found</h2>\n<p>This procedure applied to the entire Crossref dataset resulted in 20,846 links between research outputs and grants<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">5</a></sup>. Of those, 12 were flagged as unreliable, because they involved more than one grant linked to the same item and award number. The rest of this section focuses on the remaining 20,834 links.</p>\n<p>Within the 20,834 links, we have 17,082 research outputs and 3,858 (10.1%) grants.</p>\n<p>Here is the breakdown into the verification approaches used:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Verification</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">#links</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">%links</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>The item contains grant DOI - no verification</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">&lt;0.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Funder DOIs are the same</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">8,364</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">40.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Funder DOIs are related with a replaced/was replaced by relationship</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">3,704</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">17.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Funder DOIs are related with an ancestor/descendant relationship</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">7,718</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">37.0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Funder names are the same</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">591</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The name of the funder in the item is the same as the name of the funder that replaced/was replaced by the funder in the grant</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">364</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The name of the funder in the item is the same as the name of the ancestor or descendant of the funder in the grant</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">87</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">0.4%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In most cases, just using the funder DOIs for the verification was enough.

In general, for a funder that registers grants, the more research outputs mentioning this funder, the more links we should be able to find.</p>\n<p>And for some funders (Japan Science and Technology Agency, Melanoma Research Alliance, Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research, Wellcome Trust, James S. McDonnell Foundation), the number of linked outputs is indeed high, as compared with how many outputs mention the funder in the first place. This suggests our procedure was quite successful in linking outputs funded by these funders, meaning that in general the metadata in their grants and the funding information in the research outputs match.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we have a few funders for which we managed to link only a very small fraction of research outputs. There are several potential explanations here. A simple one is that not all relevant grants have been deposited yet. For example, a funder might be registering new grants only, whereas many research outputs mention older, not yet registered grants. It is also possible that there are systematic differences in how the publishers deposit the funding information in articles and other outputs, and how it is given in grants. Such differences might prevent us from establishing links, contributing to the overall low percentage of linked grants.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-importance-of-being-precise\">The importance of being precise</h3>\n<p>Here are some examples of existing links that should&rsquo;ve been found, but were not.</p>\n<p>The award number in grant <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.48105/pc.gr.93156\" target=\"_blank\">10.48105/pc.gr.93156</a> is <code>CTF-2020-01-004</code>. This article: <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.3390/ijms22094716\" target=\"_blank\">10.3390/ijms22094716</a> mentions award number <code>2020‐01‐004</code> and the same funder (Children&rsquo;s Tumor Foundation). It is very probable that this is the same grant, but our procedure expects exactly the same award number, and so the two were not linked.</p>\n<p>Paper <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1128/genomea.00159-18\" target=\"_blank\">10.1128/genomea.00159-18</a> contains award number <code>1931</code> and U.S. Department of Energy as the funder. There are two grants with the same award number and funder: <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.46936/10.25585/60001053\" target=\"_blank\">10.46936/10.25585/60001053</a> and <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.46936/genr.proj.2000.1931/60002530\" target=\"_blank\">10.46936/genr.proj.2000.1931/60002530</a>. It is difficult to choose between them, and these links were marked as unreliable.</p>\n<p>These examples could be signs of systematic errors and/or discrepancies that effectively prevent linking of those funders&rsquo; grants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&rsquo;s next</h2>\n<p>In problems such as linking grants to research outputs, there are typically two key ingredients of the success, which at the same time are the main areas of improvement: the quality of the metadata, and the strength of the linking approach.</p>\n<p>The metadata could be improved greatly by addressing existing discrepancies between grants and research outputs and allowing (and encouraging!) the publishers to provide grant DOIs in the funding information. Thankfully, we are not alone in those efforts. Both this recent <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.54900/rgrtzxx-nj4c28m-cef53\" target=\"_blank\">Upstream blog</a> from Alexis-Michel Mugabushaka, and this <a href=\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2022/03/07/accelerating-open-research-a-multi-stakeholder-discussion/\" target=\"_blank\">Scholarly Kitchen post</a> from Robert Harrington call for the development and adoption of grant DOIs in scholarly metadata.</p>\n<p>In terms of the linking approach, there are some ideas that could be used to further improve the linking accuracy and completeness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The verification by funder name could be fuzzy and allow for minor variations like typos or additional words.</li>\n<li>Apart from <em>replaced/replaced by</em> and <em>ancestor/descendant</em>, there are other relationships between funders in the Funder Registry: <em>continuation of</em>, <em>incorporates/incorporated into</em>, <em>merged with</em>, <em>renamed as</em>, <em>split into/split from</em>. We could also consider those relationships during the funder validation.</li>\n<li>Apart from the funder information, there is other information that could be potentially used for verification, for example, the names of the authors and the investigators, the domain, or keywords.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any questions, do <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">get in touch</a>!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>All numbers are as of March 8, 2022&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:gbmf7622\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:gbmf7622</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\">\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:gbmf7622,type:grant\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:gbmf7622,type:grant</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:4\">\n<p><a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:2817\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:2817</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:5\">\n<p>The code and data available here: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs_data_analyses/-/tree/master/analyses/22-01-26-grants-matching\" target=\"_blank\">https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs_data_analyses/-/tree/master/analyses/22-01-26-grants-matching</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:5\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"},{"id":null,"title":"A Registry of Editorial Boards - a new trust signal for scholarly communications?","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-registry-of-editorial-boards-a-new-trust-signal-for-scholarly-communications/","published":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Background Perhaps, like us, you&rsquo;ve noticed that it is not always easy to find information on who is on a journal&rsquo;s editorial board and, when you do, it is often unclear when it was last updated....","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Fabienne Michaud","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Perhaps, like us, you&rsquo;ve noticed that it is not always easy to find information on who is on a journal&rsquo;s editorial board and, when you do, it is often unclear when it was last updated. The editorial board details might be displayed in multiple places (such as the publisher&rsquo;s website and the platform where the content is hosted) which may or may not be in sync and retrieving this information for any kind of analysis always requires manually checking and exporting the data from a website (as illustrated by the <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jvzq7\" target=\"_blank\">Open Editors research</a> and its <a href=\"https://openeditors.ooir.org\" target=\"_blank\">dataset</a>).</p>\n<p>For well-established as well as early career researchers, membership of an editorial board demonstrates their contribution to their community, brings prestige, improves (or maintains) their professional profile and often increases their chances of being published.</p>\n<p>Whilst most journal websites only give the names of the editors, others possibly add a country, some include affiliations, very few link to a professional profile, an ORCID ID. Even when it&rsquo;s clear when the editorial board details were updated, it&rsquo;s hardly ever possible to find past editorial boards information and almost none lists declarations of competing interest.</p>\n<p>We hear of instances where a researcher&rsquo;s name has been listed on the board of a journal without their knowledge or agreement, potentially to deceive other researchers into submitting their manuscripts.

We adopted POSI to ensure that Crossref would not meet the same fate.</p>\n<p>POSI proposes three areas that an Open Infrastructure organization can address to garner the trust of the broader scholarly community: accountability (governance), funding (sustainability), and protection of community interests (insurance). POSI also proposes a set of concrete commitments that an organization can make to build community trust in each area. There are 16 such commitments.</p>\n<p>In our announcement of Crossref’s adoption of POSI, we made two critical points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One doesn’t have to meet all the commitments of POSI already to adopt it. For one thing, this would make it impossible for new organizations to adopt POSI. So instead, we should view the adoption of the POSI principles as a “statement of intent” against which stakeholders can measure an organization&rsquo;s progress.</li>\n<li>That, conversely, meeting all of the POSI principles doesn’t mean an organization can relax. It is always possible for an organization to regress on a particular commitment. For example, an emergency expenditure might mean that the organization no longer maintains a 12-month contingency fund and therefore has to replenish it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these two points made, we ended our announcement with a candid self-audit against the principles. We concluded that Crossref was already entirely or partially meeting the requirements of 15 of the 16 POSI commitments. And adopting the 16th commitment would just formalize a direction Crossref had already been heading toward for several years. We also said that we would update our self-audit regularly.</p>\n<p>But before we continue with the Crossref POSI audit update, we should talk about the immediate aftermath of our adopting the principles.</p>\n<p>Since Crossref adopted POSI, <a href=\"https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/\" target=\"_blank\">nine other organizations have made the same commitment</a> and conducted similar self-audits. We affectionately call them the “POSI Posse”.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dryad</li>\n<li>ROR</li>\n<li>JOSS</li>\n<li>OurResearch</li>\n<li>OpenCitations</li>\n<li>DataCite</li>\n<li>OA Switchboard</li>\n<li>Sciety</li>\n<li>Europe PMC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These organizations represent a critical part of the hidden infrastructure that scholarly research depends on every day. By committing to POSI, they are helping ensure their accountability to the research community. They are also emphasizing that stakeholders must participate in the governance and stewardship of organizations running that infrastructure.</p>\n<p>But perhaps most importantly- these ten organizations that have publicly committed to adopting POSI will not suddenly disappear or change priorities without giving the community time to react and, if need be, intervene.</p>\n<p>There are also more quotidian advantages to these organizations adopting POSI. Adopting the principles makes it easier for the respective organizations to collaborate to make research infrastructure more effective and efficient. The foundation of effective collaboration is trust. And, so by agreeing that we share basic principles of operation, we virtually eliminate a whole slew of negotiations that typically need to occur before two organizations trust each other enough to collaborate closely on projects.</p>\n<p>One of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy/#collaborate-and-partner\">Crossref’s strategic priorities</a> is to “collaborate and partner” with other organizations on improving our open scholarly infrastructure. And the easiest way to collaborate with us is to adhere to the same principles. So we look forward to more scholarly infrastructure organizations adopting POSI in 2022 so that, together, we can make research infrastructure work better.</p>\n<p>Establishing this level of trust has already paid significant dividends with the Research Organization Registry (ROR) - a relatively new infrastructure project founded jointly by DataCite, CDL, and Crossref.</p>\n<p>Having nine organizations adopt POSI so soon after our announcement was a wonderful feeling. It is hard for us to convey how happy we are about this without gushing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/staff/geoff_720px.jpg\">Here is a picture of me gushing.</a></p>\n<p>But now we have some outstanding business to update our self-audit.</p>\n<p>This post is the first of our regular updates on our progress (or regress) on meeting the POSI principles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2>\n<p>We didn’t regress on any commitment. We’ve improved a little bit where we were not meeting the POSI principles, but we have still not met all our POSI commitments.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Area</th>\n<th>Commitment</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">2020</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">2021</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Governance</strong></td>\n<td>Coverage across the research enterprise</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Non-discriminatory membership</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Transparent operations</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Cannot lobby</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Living will</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Formal incentives to fulfill mission &amp;

Our board did not yet reflect our members&rsquo; diversity or the broader stakeholder community. In particular, as funders have become more central to shaping the scholarly communications landscape, it seemed important that Crossref have funder representation in our governance.</p>\n<p>So this year, the Crossref nominations committee was charged with proposing a board slate that addressed some of our representational gaps. They did this, and as a direct result, two of the members elected to next year&rsquo;s board were a funder (Melanoma Research Alliance) and a significant preprint platform (Center for Open Science).</p>\n<p>These new additions to our board mark a significant improvement in stakeholder governance, but we can do more. Researchers and research institutions are also substantial Crossref stakeholders. We need to have a better representation of their concerns.</p>\n<p>Also, there are still members of the scholarly communications community who depend on Crossref but cannot afford to join it because our fees are too high for them. Since membership is a prerequisite to participation in Crossref governance, we are also placing emphasis on figuring out how to further extend Crossref membership to those who still cannot afford it, through programs like Sponsorship, country-level journal gap analyses work, and a forthcoming fee review. So this is a source of stakeholder governance inequity that may be best handled by our membership &amp; fees committee rather than our nominations committee.</p>\n<p>In short, we’ve made progress on our stakeholder governance commitment. Still, we need to do more- so we are updating our adherence to the POSI stakeholder governance principle from red to yellow.</p>\n<p>Another place where we have improved things is under the banner of “transparency.” But here, we see one of the shortcomings of the ‘traffic light” representation used in the self-audit. The degree that one meets a commitment falls along a gradient. And this gradient cannot be represented accurately in the ternary classification of red/yellow/green. So while last year we marked ourselves as “green” under the commitment to transparency, over the past year we have become <em>greener.</em> We did this by creating sections on our website that provide further detail on our governance and finances- even including the 990 forms that are required by US tax authorities for non-profits when they submit their taxes. So what do we do here? Make it neon-green? Make it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_element\" target=\"_blank\">blink</a>?</p>\n<h3 id=\"sustainability-moves-from-yellow-to-chartreuse-stays-yellow\">Sustainability <del>moves from yellow to chartreuse</del> stays yellow</h3>\n<p>In our first self-audit, we had several yellow marks- places where we were doing OK, but where we needed to make improvements.</p>\n<p>The first yellow mark involved one of the principles of “sustainability,” which stipulates that an organization should have a goal to create a contingency fund to support operations for 12 months. At the time, we had a contingency fund of 9 months. The board instructed the finance committee to develop a plan for meeting the new 12-month goal. To do this, the board decided to create three funds. The first is fairly flexible and holds operating expenses for three months. Staff leadership can use this fund at their discretion to manage cash flow issues and support budgeted expenses. The second fund is the fund that holds operating expenses for 12 months. This fund is board-restricted and is only meant to be used in emergencies to help with substantial changes in our financial position or to, in extremis, fund an orderly wind-down of Crossref’s operations. Furthermore, the board’s investment committee established guidelines for investing our operating and investment surpluses. Any surpluses are first applied to supporting the 3-month fund. Once that funding goal is met, any surpluses are applied to the 12-month fund. And once both the 3-month and 12-month funding goals are met, any further surpluses will be put into another board-restricted fund that can be used to fund new investments or new Crossref initiatives.</p>\n<p>But again, the simple yellow mark against this item does not capture this level of detail. We only get to turn it green once we have the 12-month fund in place.</p>\n<p>It looks like we will meet the goal in 2022, but it is hard to say exactly when. If we did shades of color- we might make it chartreuse. But nobody wants to see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_%28color%29\" target=\"_blank\">chartreuse</a>. So while we have made significant progress here, our commitment to maintaining a 12-month contingency fund remains yellow until we have reached our goal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patent-non-assertion-stays-yellow\">Patent non-assertion stays yellow</h3>\n<p>The second yellow mark was against our publishing a patent-non-assertion statement. This feels like a missed opportunity because it will be straightforward for us to do, but we have not yet done it. We have never applied for patents, and we don’t intend to start. In short, nothing is blocking us from doing this other than our natural reluctance to have to draft anything that involves lawyers. Our lawyers are very nice people, but everything we have to draft with them makes our eyes glaze over. We need to get this done ASAP in 2022.</p>\n<h3 id=\"open-source-remains-yellow\">Open source remains yellow</h3>\n<p>The third yellow mark makes me cringe because, as technical director, it is firmly in my bailiwick. We have committed to open-sourcing all of our code. In last year’s self-audit, I predicted that we should be able to open all of our code within 12 to 18 months. I was wrong. That means this commitment remains yellow. And what’s more- it is likely to remain yellow for a year or two. Let me try and explain why.</p>\n<p>First, I should note that all new services that we’ve written since 2007 have been released as open-source (under an MIT license). These include our REST API, Crossmark, Metadata Search, and Event Data. You can find all our open-source code on <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/\" target=\"_blank\">Gitlab</a>.</p>\n<p>This leaves us with our “content system” with its legacy code, which handles content registration, OAI-PMH, OpenURL, and XML APIs. This code was originally developed for Crossref by a third party (who I won’t name because they are in no way to blame for our predicament). Crossref only took over the development of the code base internally ~ 2010. But the system has accumulated over twenty years of technical debt and includes many once-common engineering practices that are deprecated (to put it delicately). Additionally, the code is a labyrinth of dependencies on very old libraries under very old licenses.</p>\n<p>And although we have spent much of the past two years replacing critical parts of the system’s authentication and authorization code, I am certain that there remain swathes of code that, under scrutiny, would prove a security nightmare.</p>\n<p>Now we know that so-called “security through obscurity” is bad practice. Our legacy code base illustrates the point. We had credentials embedded in the code. We had backdoors and application-level root access. We had countless places where we didn’t sanitize input. But the code was private- and so it gave developers a false sense of confidence when they occasionally made these shortcuts in the interest of developing new features more quickly. And in those early days of hyper-growth, we often had to develop things very, very quickly. Technical debt, like any debt, is a tradeoff.</p>\n<p>As I said- we’ve cleaned a ton of this stuff up. For example, we’ve replaced our primary authentication system. But this experience has made us better appreciate just how difficult it would be to harden a system this old.</p>\n<p>And besides, we are already replacing it - albeit incrementally. We have been extracting and rewriting key components of the old system, and we plan to continue to extract and rewrite until there is nothing left of the old code. All this new code is, naturally, open-source. And it follows modern security practices.</p>\n<p>And so we face a difficult choice- do we try and fix code that is hard to fix and that we are replacing anyway- or do we just focus just on replacing the code and making sure the new, open-source code follows modern security best -practices? We’ve chosen to take the latter route. But it does mean this entry will have a yellow circle next to it for a few more years as we replace things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"open-data-moves-from-yellow-to-green\">Open data moves from yellow to green</h3>\n<p>And this brings us to our final yellow mark- which was next to the principle of open data. The root of the problem is that what we colloquially call “Crossref metadata” is a mix of elements, some of which come from our members, some from third parties, and some from Crossref itself. These elements, in turn, each have different copyright implications.</p>\n<p>On top of this, Crossref has terms and conditions for its members and terms and conditions for specific services. These terms and conditions grant Crossref the right to do things with some classes of metadata and not do things with other classes of metadata - regardless of copyright.</p>\n<p>The net result is that users can freely use and redistribute any metadata they retrieve via our APIs or in our periodic public data files. But it also means we cannot just slap a CC0 waiver on all the data. Instead, we have to specify exactly what copyright and terms apply to each class of data. We’d never done this in a clear and accessible way, so some of our users were understandably concerned that maybe we were hedging or perhaps the reuse rights were unclear. But we are not hedging; they are clear. They just weren&rsquo;t documented. <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/rest-api-metadata-license-information/\">And now they are</a>. In human-readable form. And soon-to-be in machine-readable form. So we can move this from yellow to green.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflections-on-the-year-since-our-adoption-of-posi\">Reflections on the year since our adoption of POSI</h2>\n<p>When the Crossref board adopted POSI last year, frankly, a few of us were surprised. We never doubted Crossref’s direction as an open infrastructure organization, but we were not sure that others would see the value in making a public commitment to the principles. We’d heard some people say that they thought adopting them would be seen as “Virtue Signaling.” Which, to be fair, it is. This shouldn’t be surprising or contentious. Our entire scholarly communication system is based on virtue signaling. But, of course, the term “virtue signaling” (with scare quotes) is also sometimes used to insinuate that such signaling is disingenuous and designed primarily for marketing purposes. And that would be a real danger. But the principles were drafted with a built-in safeguard against disingenuous use. The commitments POSI lists are practical things that can be verified by anyone. Is our data open? Does the diversity of our board reflect the diversity of our stakeholders?</p>\n<p>So from the start, we knew that the community would be able to hold us to our commitments. And knowing that made it imperative that we develop a mechanism and process for tracking whether we were meeting them. Thus was born the self-audit.</p>\n<p>And the self-audit, in turn, has served as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_function\" target=\"_blank\">forcing function</a> to ensure that we didn’t just launch a proclamation and then forget about it. We needed to integrate our POSI commitments into all aspects of our day-to-day work. As such, “Live up to POSI” is now a prominent part of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy/#live-up-to-posi\">Crossref’s Strategic Agenda</a>. POSI has become a fundamental part of our planning and our <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/02zsQaeA/crossref-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\">public product roadmap</a>. POSI has even become a part of our internal staff annual development plans.</p>\n<p>Adopting POSI has changed the way we work. It has changed the way the board works. It has changed the way staff works.</p>\n<p>And we hope that it is having a similar effect on our fellow POSI Posse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-how-about-changing-the-way-posi-works\">But how about changing the way POSI works?</h2>\n<p>Now that Crossref and the nine other members of the POSI Posse have had a year of considering and/or living up to the POSI standards, what would we change? What would we add?</p>\n<p>A few themes have started to emerge as we’ve fielded questions from the current POSI Posse and others who have expressed an interest in adopting POSI.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does POSI apply to non-membership organizations?</li>\n<li>Can POSI apply to commercial organizations?</li>\n<li>How could POSI be extended to apply to open infrastructure organizations <em>outside</em> of scholarly communication?</li>\n<li>How in the hell do you pronounce “POSI?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ve tried to answer some of these questions in <a href=\"https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">the POSI FAQ</a>, but can we update POSI so that we don’t need the FAQ? Or at least so that we can start a new FAQ?</p>\n<p>And, critically, if we change POSI, how do we ensure we make it stronger and not weaker? Because, to be candid, some of the questions that we’ve fielded have come from parties concerned that POSI is too restrictive. That, for example, the stipulation that revenue should be based on services and not on data makes for inflexible business models. Yes. It does. Deliberately.</p>\n<p>Because one of the biggest barriers to a community being able to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29\" target=\"_blank\">fork</a> digital infrastructure is closed (incl. fee-based) data. And one of the fundamental positions of POSI is one the authors learned from open-source communities. This is that these efforts can fail no matter how much care you take to ensure financial sustainability and how much care you take to ensure community-based governance. The ultimate power the open-source community has is to take the code and fork it. This is the insurance policy that helps keep open source projects honest. And we have tried our best to bake this lesson into the POSI principles. We don’t want to weaken POSI. They are, after all, principles.</p>\n<p>So in 2022, we look forward to more organizations endorsing POSI. And the current POSI Posse has started a conversation about how we can strengthen the principles and also extend them so that they can more easily be applied to different kinds of organizations and perhaps even in different sectors. A summary of these discussions will be published in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>But how will we open these conversations to the broader community? How will we engage those who have yet to adopt the principles but are interested in doing so? What about those interested but perhaps only if they are adapted in some way?</p>\n<p>We already have a mechanism for soliciting feedback, questions, and suggestions concerning POSI. However, it is a relatively primitive system, based on either sending email to one of the POSI Posse or <a href=\"https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/feedback/\" target=\"_blank\">raising a GitLab ticket</a>. It was the best we could do in the short time we had to put together the POSI site. An <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product\" target=\"_blank\">MVP</a>, if you will. The feedback mechanism served us well over the past year; we engaged with many interested parties and even managed to help nine of them adopt the principles.</p>\n<p>But as with all things POSI - there is room for improvement. And so, we hope to have a more user-friendly way to solicit public feedback and hold discussions. This feedback and our own experiences with adopting POSI over the past year will, in turn, inform our efforts at revising POSI to take into account the things we’ve learned since POSI was originally written.</p>\n<p>So look out for announcements on <a href=\"https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the POSI site</a>. And we look forward to another year of expanding the list of POSI adopters and continuing our own POSI progress. If you’re POSI-curious, get in touch with any of the ten POSI adopters to start a conversation about your own path towards truly open infrastructure.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Image integrity: Help us figure out the scale of the problem","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/image-integrity-help-us-figure-out-the-scale-of-the-problem/","published":"Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Some context The Similarity Check Advisory Group met a number of times last year to discuss current and emerging originality issues with text-based content.

We monitor data archives, Wikipedia, social media, blogs, news, and other sources. Our main focus has been on gathering data from external sources, however we know that there is a great deal of Crossref metadata that can be made available as events. Earlier this year we started adding <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/doing-more-with-relationships-via-event-data/\">relationship metadata</a>, and over the last few months we have been working on bringing in citations between records.</p>\n<p>Our members deposit references alongside other metadata, and we have a lot of them. In fact, we have over 1.2 billion, with hundreds of thousands of new references added each day. While our metadata APIs make it easy to see which works are cited, it is much more difficult to find a list of citations to a specific work. We can make this easier by presenting citations as events in Event Data. Now that the huge majority of our members have responded positively to the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</a> campaign and Crossref’s open-by-default reference policy, the move to make this data available via Event Data is a natural step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-bumpy-ride-but-we-got-there\">A bumpy ride, but we got there</h2>\n<p>Adding such a large amount of data means a significant increase in the data coming into Event Data, which has presented some challenges. We’ve known for some time that Event Data is <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/event-data-a-plan-of-action/\" target=\"_blank\">not very stable</a>, but we expected it to cope with the new data coming in. We have mitigated by initially only looking at new data, not trying to immediately back-fill with old references. Unfortunately, even with this limitation it hasn’t been a smooth ride, and our first effort to put references into Event Data uncovered bugs we didn’t know about and we had to walk back the changes.\nWe tried again and found that we were hitting rate limits for our own APIs. This is a sure sign of technical debt: we shouldn’t need to be shifting large amounts of our own data from one place to another, and not at rates that could be putting stress on APIs used by others in the community.</p>\n<p>We have managed to work around these problems and I’m pleased to say that we are now adding metadata from reference lists to Event Data. They can be accessed via the Event Data API:\n<a href=\"https://api.eventdata.crossref.org/v1/events?rows=10&source=crossref&relation-type=references&from-collected-date=2021-10-01\"><a href=\"https://api.eventdata.crossref.org/v1/events?rows=10&amp;source=crossref&amp;relation-type=references&amp;from-collected-date=2021-10-01\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.eventdata.crossref.org/v1/events?rows=10&source=crossref&relation-type=references&from-collected-date=2021-10-01</a></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-next\">Where to next?</h2>\n<p>There remains work to be done. We would like to backfill references, and there is also further work to include relationships to objects that have identifiers other than Crossref records (genes, proteins, ArXiv identifiers, and so on). Our work on <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/event-data-help-us-fill-in-the-gaps/\">investigating sources</a> is proceeding and we will be looking to add more next year. While possible, these steps will be costly and time-consuming if we proceed without significant changes to the infrastructure supporting Event Data.</p>\n<p>When we started Event Data the volumes of data were much smaller and our infrastructure coped well, but as <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/doing-more-with-relationships-via-event-data/\">we’ve said here before</a>, it’s in need of an overhaul. In fact, our recent experience and some other considerations are making us look at some very fundamental changes in how we record events.</p>\n<p>We are therefore working on a new data model that will allow events to be stored alongside the rest of our metadata. This work is still in the early stages, but if we are successful it will mean that we won’t need to move data between databases. It will also make it easier to provide access to all of our reference metadata along with other relationships that we’re not currently able to provide, and give us the capacity to add new data sources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-references\">Open references</h2>\n<p><em>[EDIT 6th June 2022 - all references are now open by default with the March 2022 board vote to remove any restrictions on reference distribution].</em></p>\n<p>It is worth noting that only <em>open</em> references will be available via Event Data. This covers 88% of works with references at present. Members have the option to deposit references with <em>limited</em> visibility, meaning only <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/metadata-plus/\">Metadata Plus</a> users can access them; or <em>closed</em> visibility, meaning that only the member who owns the cited work can retrieve the citation, via <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/cited-by/\">Cited-by</a>.</p>\n<p>We encourage our members to make their references open and deposit them as metadata. It makes them usable downstream by thousands of tools that researchers use. Including open references also improves the quality of metadata, and there are reciprocal benefits for the large number of members who openly share their reference data: they contribute to a large, openly available pool of data with many applications that advance research, and drives usage of the content published by our members.</p>\n<p>If you are a Crossref member and unsure whether your reference metadata is open or not, check your <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">participation report</a>. This will tell you the percentage of your records with deposited references, and the percentage of those that are open. You can change the reference visibility preference for each DOI prefix that you own by contacting our <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001642691\" target=\"_blank\">support team</a>.

So have the look and see what useful things you can discover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-started\">How it started</h2>\n<p>Back in 2017 we posted the outcomes of some discussions with a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders/\">newly-reformed Funder Advisory Group</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/global-persistent-identifiers-for-grants-awards-and-facilities/\">plotting Crossref&rsquo;s path</a>. In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/wellcome-explains-the-benefits-of-developing-an-open-and-global-grant-identifier/\">Wellcome described their rationale for supporting the grants effort</a> with the help of Europe PMC, and in 2019 the sub-groups of the Advisory Board put out <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/request-for-feedback-on-grant-identifier-metadata/\">a call for feedback on the metadata plan</a> as the fee model they created was also approved by our board.</p>\n<p>Since late 2019, research funders have been registering metadata and identifiers for their grants with us. We currently have a healthy 26k grants registered with us, via 13 funding organisations. I’d specifically highlight Wellcome for volume (<a href=\"http://blog.europepmc.org/2020/06/global-grant-ids-in-europe-pmc.html\" target=\"_blank\">registering via Europe PMC</a>), and the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) who was the first funder that included ROR IDs in their grant metadata, really getting the value of connecting all related entities and contributors.</p>\n<p>The reasons for registering grants with Crossref? Let&rsquo;s recap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support of open data and information about grants</li>\n<li>Streamlined discovery of funded content</li>\n<li>Improved analytics and data quality</li>\n<li>More complete picture of outputs and impact</li>\n<li>Better value from investments in reporting services</li>\n<li>Improved timeliness, completeness and accuracy of reporting: save time for researchers</li>\n<li>More complete information to support analysis and evaluation without relying on manual data entry</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/funder-visual.png\" width=\"75%\"/>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-its-going\">How it&rsquo;s going</h2>\n<p>For grant information to be used, it’s key that it is is openly available and disseminated as widely as possible. That work starts with funders registering their grants, and continues with us. Now that we’ve completed the REST API&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/behind-the-scenes-improvements-to-the-rest-api/\">Elasticsearch migration</a>, we’re happy to announce that all our grant information is now available via our REST API.</p>\n<p>Here’s a snippet of the kind of metadata you can see related to the grants registered with us.

Our strategy has been successful in delivering high quality PhD training, leveraging individual funding and programme funding in order to place students in productive groups and provide high quality supervision and mentorship. Here we plan to consolidate and build on these outputs to address long-term sustainability. We will emphasise the full career path needed to generate research leaders. KWTRP aims to address capacity building for research through an initiative that employs a progressive and long term outlook in the development of local research leadership.

This is that update.</p>\n<p>Crossref hosts its services in a hybrid environment. Our original services are all hosted in a data center in Massachusetts, but we host new services with a cloud provider. We also have a few R&amp;D systems hosted with Hetzner.</p>\n<p>We know an organization our size has no business running its own data center, and we have been slowly moving services out of the data center and into the cloud.</p>\n<p>For example, over the past nine months, we have moved our authentication service and our <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">REST APIs</a> to the cloud.</p>\n<p>And, we are working on moving the other existing services too. For example, we are in the midst of moving <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/\" target=\"_blank\">Event Data</a> and, our next target, after Event Data, is the content registration system.</p>\n<p>All new services are deployed to the cloud by default.</p>\n<p>While moving services out of the data center, we have also been trying to shore up the data center to ensure it continues to function during the transition. One of the weaknesses we identified in the data center was that the same provider managed both our primary network connection <em>and</em> our backup connection (albeit- on entirely different physical networks). We understood that we really needed a separate provider to ensure adequate redundancy, and we had already had a third network drop installed from a different provider. But, unfortunately, it had not yet been activated and connected.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, our original network provider for the first two connections informed us months ago that they would be doing some major work on our <em>backup</em> connection. However, they assured us that it would not affect the primary connection- something we confirmed with them repeatedly since we knew our replacement backup connection was not yet active.</p>\n<p>But, the change our provider made <em>did</em> affect <em>both</em> the backup (as intended) and the primary (not intended). They were as surprised as we were, which kind of underscores why we want two separate providers as well as two separate network connections.</p>\n<p>So both our primary and secondary networks went down while we had not yet activated our replacement secondary network.</p>\n<p>Also, our only <em>local</em> infrastructure team member was in surgery at the time (He is fine. It was routine. Thanks for asking).</p>\n<p>This meant we had to send a local developer to the data center, but the data center’s authentication process had changed since the last time said developer had visited (pre-pandemic). So, yeah, it took us a long time to even get into the data center.</p>\n<p>By then, our infrastructure team member was out of surgery and on the phone with our network provider, who realized their mistake and reverted everything. This whole process (getting network connectivity restored, not the surgery) took almost two hours.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the outage didn’t just affect services hosted in the data center. It also affected our cloud-hosted systems. This is because all of our requests were still routed to the data center first, after which those destined for the cloud were split out and redirected. This routing made sense when the bulk of our requests were for services hosted in the data center. But, within the past month, that calculus had shifted. Most of our requests now are for cloud-based services. We were scheduled to switch to routing traffic through our cloud provider first, and had this been in place, many of our services would have continued running during the data center outage.</p>\n<p>It is very tempting to stop this explanation here and leave people with the impression that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The root cause of the outage was the unpredicted interaction between the maintenance on our backup line and the functionality of our primary line;</li>\n<li>Our slowness to respond was exclusively down to one of the two members of our infrastructure staff being (<em>cough</em>) indisposed at the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But the whole event uncovered several other issues as well.</p>\n<p>Namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even if one of our three lines had stayed active, the routers in the data center would not have cut over to the redundant working system because we had misconfigured them and we had not tested them;</li>\n<li>We did not keep current documentation on the changing security processes for accessing the data center;</li>\n<li>Our alerting system does not support the kind of escalation logic, and coverage-scheduling that would have allowed us to automatically detect when our primary data center administrator didn’t respond (being in surgery and all) and redirect alerts and warnings to secondary responders; and</li>\n<li>We need to accelerate our move out of the data center.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are we doing to address these issues?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completing the installation of the backup connection with a second provider;</li>\n<li>Scheduling a test of our router’s cutover processes where we will actually pull the plug on our primary connection to ensure that failover is working as intended. We will give users ample warning before conducting this test;</li>\n<li>Revising our emergency contact procedures and updating our documentation for navigating our data center’s security process;</li>\n<li>Replacing our alerting system with one that gives us better control over escalation rules; and</li>\n<li>Adding a third FTE to the infrastructure team to help us accelerate our move to the cloud and to implement infrastructure management best practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>October 6th, 2021, was a bad day. But we’ve learned from it. So if we have a bad day in the future, it will at least be different.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"More new faces at Crossref","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/more-new-faces-at-crossref/","published":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Looking at the road ahead, we’ve set some ambitious goals for ourselves and continue to see new members join from around the world, now numbering 16,000.

During my career, I have worked mostly in the banking and engineering industries so this is my first time working in scholarly publishing. I confess that before joining Crossref I wasn’t aware that the community existed so I was excited to see how I could ply my trade in this new (to me!) field. The role also appealed as, having primarily been a team leader/line manager in my recent career, this was an opportunity to be hands-on again and work with modern languages such as Kotlin. In the end, though, what really sealed it for me was reading on the Crossref website that ‘we take the work seriously but not necessarily ourselves’ which basically sums me up.

Even though we&rsquo;ve been moving many of our services to the cloud, all our traffic was still routed through the data centre - so when it went down, most of our cloud services were unavailable as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It took us a long time to fix this because our infrastructure team only has two people in it. Only one of them is located near the data centre and was at the doctor’s when the outage occurred. Although we were alerted to the problem immediately, we had to send one of our development team members to the data centre to diagnose and fix the problem.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We have been aware of these weaknesses in our system since I took the role of director of technology in 2019, and we have been putting most of our efforts over the past two years into fixing them.</p>\n<p>We know that an organisation of our size has no business trying to run and maintain a physical data centre ourselves. One of the strengths of cloud-based systems is that they can be administered from anywhere and don&rsquo;t require anyone to physically go to a data centre to replace failed hardware or check that network connections are, in fact, live. We&rsquo;ve been trying to move to the cloud as fast as we can. All new services that we build are cloud-based. At the same time we&rsquo;ve been moving systems out of the data centre - starting with those that put the biggest load on our systems. To further aid this process we have budgeted to add an FTE to the infrastructure team in 2022.</p>\n<p>What is really painful about this event is that we had just completed the last bit of work we needed to do before changing our traffic routing so that it would hit the cloud first instead of the data centre first. This would not have avoided the outage we just experienced, but it would have made it a bit less severe.</p>\n<p>What is even more painful is that we had recently installed a <em>third</em> network connection with an entirely different provider because we were worried about just this kind of situation. But this third connection wasn’t yet active.</p>\n<p>We already have a long list of tickets that we’ve created to address problems we faced in recovering from this outage. The list will undoubtedly grow as we complete a postmortem over the next few days. I will report back when we have more detail of what happened and have a solid plan for how to avoid anything similar in the future.</p>\n<p>We know that an outage of this severity and duration has caused a lot of people who depend on our services extra work and anxiety.

We know some of you have been waiting a long time for this upgrade and we are very happy to share with you that we are now ready to release it.</p>\n<p>We will be rolling out this new version in stages, so not everyone will be able to upgrade to the new version immediately. We&rsquo;ll start with new Crossref Similarity Check subscribers who use iThenticate in the browser, and one member who uses iThenticate via the eJournalPress API integration.</p>\n<p>Next month, we will reach out to existing Crossref Similarity Check subscribers who use iThenticate in the browser (rather than through a manuscript tracking system), and further eJournalPress users.  From then on, we&rsquo;ll be contacting those of you who use Similarity Check through your manuscript tracking system, as and when your providers are ready to work with the new version.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crossref-similarity-check---first-things-first\">Crossref Similarity Check - first things first</h2>\n<p>Crossref Similarity Check is a content comparison tool, powered by iThenticate and produced by Turnitin, to check the originality of scholarly works and detect potential cases of plagiarism. Crossref members are eligible for this service, which offers them a reduced rate for document checking (plus enhanced functionality) in exchange for making their own published content available to be indexed into the iThenticate database.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check\">The Crossref Similarity Check service</a> continues to grow in membership (1,531 members in 2020; 1,964 members in 2021, to date) and in the number of documents checked (1,922,621 manuscripts checked between January and July 2020 and 2,419,612 over the same period this year).</p>\n<p>Just as with the current version of iThenticate, Crossref Similarity Check subscribers will be able to compare documents against a vast database of internet sources and over 78 million full-text documents contributed by the Crossref members that use the service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Crossref</em> - research articles, books, and conference proceedings provided by publishers of scholarly content all over the world</li>\n<li><em>Crossref posted content</em> - preprints, eprints, working papers, reports, dissertations, and many other types of content that has not been formally published but has been registered with Crossref</li>\n<li><em>Internet</em> - a database of archived and live publicly-available web pages, including billions of pages of existing content, and with tens of thousands of new pages added each day</li>\n<li><em>Publications</em> - third-party periodical, journal, and publication content including many major professional journals, periodicals, and business publications from sources other than Crossref Similarity Check members</li>\n<li><em>Your Indexed Documents</em> - other documents you have uploaded for checking (within your Crossref Similarity Check user account only, and not added to iThenticate&rsquo;s main indexes)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What&rsquo;s new</h2>\n<p>We are delighted to introduce the following new features and enhancements with iThenticate v2.0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased document upload capacity</li>\n<li>Suspicious and hidden character detection</li>\n<li>Preprint exclusion filter</li>\n<li>Refreshed and responsive interface</li>\n<li>Similarity reports - save and share</li>\n<li>Annotations</li>\n<li>Content portal</li>\n<li>Improved API</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"increased-document-upload-capacity\">Increased document upload capacity</h3>\n<p>This new version of iThenticate has an increased document upload capacity of up to 800 pages/200 MB and a Google Drive document upload functionality.

We&rsquo;ll be checking that anyone who wants to upgrade to v2.0 is still at 90% or above. You can check this yourself in advance on our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/similarity-check/participate/eligibility/\">eligibility checker</a> - if you&rsquo;ve fallen below 90%, the tool will give you instructions for adding your missing full-text Similarity Check URLs.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, you will find the Similarity Check service documentation for the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/similarity-check\">current</a> version of iThenticate on our website.

We have reverted the incorrect resolution URLs affected by this problem. And, we’re putting in place checks and changes in our processes to ensure this does not happen again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-got-here\">How we got here</h2>\n<p>Our technical support team was contacted in late June by Wiley about updating resolution URLs for their content. It&rsquo;s a common request of our technical support team, one meant to make the URL update process more efficient, but this was a particularly large request. Shortly thereafter, we were provided with nearly 1,200 separate files by Atypon on behalf of Wiley in order to update the resolution URLs of ~9 million records. We manually spot checked over 50 of these files, because, prior to this issue, our technical support team did not have a mechanism to automatically check for errors. That labor intensive review did not turn up any problems. That is, those 50 samples had no errors with the headers, like were found later.</p>\n<p>Among the files we didn’t check, there were headers included in the files with different owning <code>fromPrefix</code> and acquiring <code>toPrefix</code> members’ DOI prefixes. In a URL update request, the prefixes should always be the same.</p>\n<p>And still other files included requests to update records with DOIs that had never even been registered. Here are some examples:</p>\n<p><sub>H:email=support@crossref.org;fromPrefix=<strong>10.5555</strong>;toPrefix=<strong>10.5555</strong><br>\n10.5555/doi1 <a href=\"http://www.newurl.com/whatever\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newurl.com/whatever</a><br>\n10.5555/doi2 <a href=\"http://www.newurl.com/whatever2\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newurl.com/whatever2</a></sub></p>\n<p>In the example above, these fictional DOIs are both under prefix 10.5555. Thus, the result of this request will ONLY be that the resolution URLs of DOI 10.5555/doi1 and 10.5555/doi2 are updated in the metadata.</p>\n<p><sub>H:email=support@crossref.org;fromPrefix=<strong>10.5555</strong>;toPrefix=<strong>10.9876</strong> <br>\n10.5555/doi1 <a href=\"http://www.newurl.com/whatever\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newurl.com/whatever</a><br>\n10.5555/doi2 <a href=\"http://www.newurl.com/whatever2\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newurl.com/whatever2</a></sub></p>\n<p>In this second example, these fictional DOIs are both under prefix 10.5555, but because the <code>toPrefix</code> in the header differs from the <code>fromPrefix</code>, the result of this request will be that the resolution URLs of 10.5555/doi1 and 10.5555/doi2 are updated in the metadata AND the owning prefix of both records will be transferred from prefix 10.5555 to prefix 10.9876.</p>\n<p>We kicked off the URL update request on 30 June and all legitimate DOIs whose files were free of errors were updated by 7 July (yes, it takes about a week to update the resolution URLs for ~9 million records).</p>\n<p>On 9 July, Peter Strickland of the International Union of Crystallography, one of 22 members affected by this mistake, contacted us to enquire how/why much of their content was resolving to incorrect URLs and why ownership of their content appeared within our <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">search interface</a> to be Wiley. Peter was rightly concerned. We were, too. Our technical support team quickly elevated this issue, because, frankly, this is not the first time our finicky URL update process has caused unwanted metadata updates, albeit not quite at this volume.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-investigated-the-problem\">How we investigated the problem</h2>\n<p>We rallied our internal team. We investigated and discovered that we believed that some ~600,000 DOIs were erroneously included and updated in the requested 1,200 files. We later extended that estimate to include other conditions, in order to be as cautious as we could, to over 1 million DOIs. In the end, we determined that the incorrect files attempted updates of 1,228,041 DOIs. Due to the errors in the files (i.e., erroneous headers and non-registered DOIs), we only actually updated and then reverted 520,512 DOIs. The other 700,000+ DOIs were never updated (because of errors in the original files provided to us) or simply had never been registered with us.</p>\n<p>Prior to this mistake, Crossref had never reverted a member’s metadata update before. To be clear, and as I said above, we have had other URL update mistakes over the years, like this one; they were just smaller in scale. We knew there were holes in our process that needed to be plugged. And we knew we needed a better solution for members to manage these updates themselves without our manual intervention. So, while there were mistakes made in the files supplied to us, this was our error and we’re fixing it; more on that below.</p>\n<p>For this situation, we quickly realized that reversion of the metadata update was the best option for us, albeit we did not have an existing process in place to execute that reversion. That’s because we only keep the current version of each metadata record. We couldn’t back out of the change; we couldn’t simply restore these records to the metadata registered with us as of late June, because we no longer had an easily accessible, central record of those previous resolution URLs. What we did have was a record of all the previous submissions made against each DOI, so our technical team, focused their efforts there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-fixed-all-those-records\">How we fixed all those records</h2>\n<p>We had two errors to correct: the ownership transfers (those records that had inadvertent and mismatched from/to prefixes) and the incorrect resolution URLs. We reverted all of the ownership transfers on 9 July and then double and triple checked that ownership during the week of 12 July to ensure we didn’t miss anything.</p>\n<p>The resolution reversion was more complicated. We invested in creating a patch to identify the records that had been updated by our team, and then extract the last legitimate resolution URL registered with us by the owning member in order to revert the metadata for each record. In order to provide confidence that this mistake was contained, we also built a check into the patch to ensure that those DOIs that did have their ownership temporarily transferred were not updated during the few days that ownership was incorrect. That check helped us determine that none of the 520,512 DOIs were incorrectly updated beyond this mistaken URL update request.</p>\n<p>The technical team built and tested this patch. The tests turned up gaps in the patch, so we refined it during the week of 2021 July 12. We kicked off the reversion of these records on Monday, 19 July at 20:05 UTC and the patch completed all reversions at 20:14 UTC, Thursday, 22 July.</p>\n<p>In the end, we successfully reverted all of the resolution URLs for those 520,512 DOIs we identified; provided <a href=\"https://status.crossref.org/incidents/5cn1m2nw88rd\" target=\"_blank\">daily updates</a> and apologies to the 22 affected members; together we worked some longer hours; and persevered.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/wiley-urls-slack.png\"\nalt=\"Ed updates everyone internally on the situation and thanks all the people who worked together to resolve the issue\" width=\"80%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Ed updates everyone internally on the situation and thanks all the people who worked together to resolve the issue</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"next-up\">Next up</h2>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t want this to ever happen again. Like, never. We clearly need to make changes to our internal processes to prevent this in the future.</p>\n<p>Here’s what’s ahead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are building <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/user_stories/-/issues/651\" target=\"_blank\">a checker</a> that we can run URL update files through to automate and our checks. This means we will be able to check every single file in a large batch, rather than relying on manual and labor intensive spot-checking;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As said above, one compounding issue in this mistake was the mismatched from/to prefixes in the file headers. Our technical support team uses the same file headers to transfer ownership/stewardship of a record or set of records between members AND to update resolution URLs. These two tasks are almost never legitimately completed in the same file. That is, there is usually a lag between ownership transfers and resolution URL updates (most members will request an ownership transfer and then a month or two later update their URLs). Because of this, simply <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/user_stories/-/issues/650\" target=\"_blank\">decoupling these two tasks</a> (feel free to follow our work at this link) would help eliminate a glaring risk, so we’re working on that too;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, we’re researching ways we can <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues/-/issues/1444\" target=\"_blank\">streamline resource resolution URL updates</a>. You can also monitor our progress on this one. No promises or specifics yet, but we’re eager to reduce toil on our technical support team, avoid problems like this one, and provide members safe and straightforward ways to better update your metadata.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for the support of the whole Crossref team and our community - and for reading this far!

Along with the California Digital Library and DataCite, our staff has been involved in setting the strategy, planning governance and sustainability, developing technical infrastructure, hiring/loaning staff, and engaging with people in person and online. In our view, it’s the best current model of a collaborative initiative between like-minded <a href=\"http://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org\" target=\"_blank\">open scholarly infrastructure (OSI)</a> organizations.</p>\n<p>Last year, Project Manager Maria Gould described <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/publishers-are-you-ready-to-ror\">the case for publishers adopting ROR</a> and ROR was ranked the number one priority at our last in-person annual meeting. Now it’s time that Crossref’s services themselves took up the baton to meet the growing demand.</p>\n<p>The inclusion of ROR in the Crossref metadata will help everyone in the scholarly ecosystem make critical connections more easily. For example, research institutions need to monitor and measure their output by the articles and other resources their researchers have produced. Journals need to know with which institutions authors are affiliated to determine eligibility for institutionally sponsored publishing agreements. Funders need to be able to discover and track the research and researchers they have supported. Academic librarians need to easily find all of the publications associated with their campus.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, GRID and ROR <a href=\"https://www.digital-science.com/press-release/grid-passes-torch-to-ror\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that after working together to seed the community-run Research Organization Registry, GRID would be retiring from public service and handing the proverbial torch over to ROR as the scholarly community’s reliable universal open identifier for affiliations. That means that our members who have been using GRID now need to consider their move to ROR and think about how they can add ROR IDs into the metadata that they manage and share through Crossref.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-plan\">The plan</h2>\n<p>We’ve been able to include ROR IDs for our grant metadata schema as affiliation information for two years, since July 2019. And the Australia Research Data Commons (ARDC) was the first member to add ROR IDs to the Crossref system in 2020. In early July, we completed the work to accept ROR IDs for affiliation assertions for all other types of records with an <code>affiliation</code> or <code>institution</code> element, such as journal articles, book chapters, preprints, datasets, dissertations, and many more.</p>\n<p>Next, we will commence the plans to support ROR in our other tools and services, such as Participation Reports. We’ll work on alignment with the Open Funder Registry and share our plans to collect the information via the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/next-steps-for-content-registration\">new user interface we’re developing for registering and managing metadata</a>. Open Journal Systems (OJS) already has a ROR Plugin, developed by the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB). This supports the collection of ROR IDs and future releases of this plugin and the OJS DOI plugin will allow including ROR IDs in the metadata sent to Crossref, to support thousands of our members to share ROR IDs via their Crossref metadata.\nWe also aim to add ROR to our metadata retrieval options, including the REST API, which recently saw the start of an unblocking with our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/behind-the-scenes-improvements-to-the-rest-api\">move to a more robust technical foundation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-call-for-participation\">The call for participation</h2>\n<p>Many Crossref publishers, funders, and service providers are already planning to integrate ROR with their systems, <a href=\"https://ror.readme.io/docs/map-other-organization-id-types-to-ror\" target=\"_blank\">map their affiliation data to ROR</a>, and include ROR in Crossref metadata. In addition to publishers and funders, libraries, repositories, and other stakeholders are developing support for ROR. For example, the <a href=\"https://journalcheckertool.org\" target=\"_blank\">Plan S Journal Checker tool</a> uses ROR IDs to let people check whether a particular journal is compliant with an author&rsquo;s funder and institutional open access policies. In addition, the ROR website shows a growing list of <a href=\"https://ror.org/integrations\" target=\"_blank\">active and in-progress ROR integrations</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/crossref-ror-workflow-diagram.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>Crossref members registering research grants via Altum’s ProposalCentral system can already add ROR IDs. Now those registering articles, books, preprints, datasets, dissertations, and other research objects, can start including much clearer and all-important affiliation metadata as part of their content registration going forward. As with all newly-introduced metadata elements, we recommend adding ROR IDs from now and ongoing, but planning a distinct project to backfill older records. We know that more than 80% of records have been updated and enriched at least once with additional and cleaner metadata, so as members do this routinely, they can include ROR IDs alongside updating URLs, license or funding information, and other metadata.</p>\n<p>For information on how ROR will be supported in the Crossref metadata, take a look at <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/schema/-/releases/0.2.0\" target=\"_blank\">our latest schema release (version 5.3.0) </a> or in this <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/schema/-/blob/master/best-practice-examples/journal.article5.3.0.xml\" target=\"_blank\">journal article example XML</a>.</p>\n<p>Join the discussion in our forum below and register for the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/\">Crossref/ROR webinar on September 29th at 3pm UTC</a> to learn all you need to know about incorporating ROR into your Crossref metadata.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"RFP: Help evaluate the reach and effects of metadata","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/rfp-help-evaluate-the-reach-and-effects-of-metadata/","published":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000","description":"UPDATE, 14 October 2021: We received several excellent proposals in response to this RFP and we’d like to thank everyone involved for their time and enthusiasm.

We took a slightly different approach to performing the cutover, so the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/behind-the-scenes-improvements-to-the-rest-api/#documentation\">Documentation</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/behind-the-scenes-improvements-to-the-rest-api/#temporary-domain\">Temporary domain</a>&rdquo; sections below have been updated.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a> is the primary interface for anybody to fetch the metadata of content registered with us, and we&rsquo;ve been working hard on a more robust REST API service that&rsquo;s about to go live.</p>\n<p>The REST API is free to use and it gets around 300 million requests each month (we encourage users to adhere to our <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#etiquette\" target=\"_blank\">etiquette guidelines</a> to keep things running smoothly). It is used for <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-metadata-for-bibliometrics/\">bibliometric studies</a>, by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/using-the-crossref-rest-api.-part-9-with-dimensions/\">platforms like Dimensions</a>, by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/using-the-crossref-rest-api.-part-6-with-nls/\">organizations like the National Library of Sweden</a>, and to support <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/user-stories/\">countless other efforts</a>.</p>\n<p>We also offer enhanced access to our APIs and other services with <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/\">Metadata Plus</a>, and we recommend it for production services and others that benefit from guaranteed up-time, a higher rate limit, and priority support from our helpful staff.</p>\n<p>For a while now, we&rsquo;ve been working to migrate the REST API from <a href=\"https://solr.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Solr</a> to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Elasticsearch</a> and from our datacenter to a cloud platform in order to address issues of scalability and extensibility.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re pleased to announce that we&rsquo;ll be cutting over to the Elasticsearch-backed version of the REST API over the next few weeks, beginning July 13. This cutover will occur one pool at a time&ndash;the public pool will be migrated first, followed by the polite pool on August 3, and the Plus pool on August 10 (see &rsquo;etiquette&rsquo; link above if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with our different pools). <em>Please note updates at the top of this post for changes to the original schedule.</em></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve thoroughly tested the functionality and performance of the new REST API, and we&rsquo;d like to invite you to test it out before we move production traffic to the new service. Try out your favorite API queries at <a href=\"https://api.production.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.production.crossref.org/</a>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"feature-parity-but-note-a-few-differences\">Feature parity, but note a few differences</h2>\n<p>One of our primary objectives was to maintain feature parity between the old and new services, avoiding any breaking changes that might cause problems for existing services integrating with the REST API. We implemented a regression test suite which has given us the confidence to make such a foundational change. During the course of this project, we found it necessary and a good opportunity to make a few modifications. In each case, we analyzed usage and aimed to avoid making any breaking changes. We hope these represent improvements to the behavior and consistency of the REST API.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>group-title</code> filter uses exact matching. This filter previously worked but was undocumented and unsupported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>directory</code> filter is deprecated. This was meant to be an experimental, unsupported filter, and the data has not met the standard we require.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>affiliation</code> facet returns counts of affiliation strings rather than counts of terms within affiliation fields (thus resolving <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/issues/405\" target=\"_blank\">this Github issue</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cursors may be used to page through results from the /members, /funders, and /journals routes, in addition to /works.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While we suggest that everyone use cursors for pagination, we still support the <code>offset</code> functionality. We have introduced a limit of 80000 for offset values for the /members /funders and /journals routes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>offset</code> behavior is slightly changed, now applying to the sum of rows and offsets rather than just offsets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>published</code> field is now present in API responses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>/licenses</code> route returns paged results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sorting by <code>submitted</code> is no longer supported. This was never officially supported or documented.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>/quality</code> route has been removed. This was an undocumented, experimental feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Funder name in <code>/works</code> metadata is the name provided by the publisher.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Empty <code>relation</code> fields correctly return an empty object.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only <code>ISBN</code> and <code>isbn-type</code> for a record will be returned. ISBNs for associated volumes will be omitted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>institution</code> field is a list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>query</code> uses different <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word\" target=\"_blank\">stop word</a> defaults, though we expect querying to remain roughly the same.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>API responses may feature slightly different scores, as they come from different backends.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"some-technical-notes-on-the-cutover\">Some technical notes on the cutover</h2>\n<h3 id=\"documentation\">Documentation</h3>\n<p>The above changes are documented in our new REST API documentation, which is now automatically generated via Swagger, resulting in more comprehensive coverage and more efficient feature development. During the cutover, the right documentation for you will depend on which pool you are using. The documentation for the new API can be found by visiting the <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">API in a browser</a>, or by navigating to <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/help\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/help</a>; and the docs for the old API remain here: <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc</a>. The Github-hosted documentation will be deprecated once the cutover is complete.</p>\n<p>This may not come as news, but bears repeating as we mentioned GitHub. We have moved our source code repositories from GitHub to <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab</a>, including all of our issue tracking.</p>\n<h3 id=\"temporary-domain\">Temporary domain </h3>\n<p>UPDATE: We ended up performing the public pool cutover via reverse proxies instead of redirects&ndash;please disregard the note about temporary domains below. The <code>api.crossref.org</code> domain will remain the domain regardless of which pool you&rsquo;re using or where we are in the cutover process.</p>\n<p><del>Please note that the <code>api.production.crossref.org</code> domain is a temporary domain we are using during this cutover period. Traffic will be redirected to the new service one pool at a time via a <code>307</code> http redirect. Once the cutover is complete, we will go back to using the <code>api.crossref.org</code> domain. Do not update any software, scripts, libraries, tools, etc. to use the temporary domain.</del></p>\n<h3 id=\"differences-in-query-results\">Differences in query results</h3>\n<p>Due to inherent differences in how Solr and Elasticsearch perform queries and rank results, you may see slightly different results when comparing the old and new services. If for whatever reason your workflow involves using multiple API pools (which we don&rsquo;t recommend), you may see inconsistent results. </p>\n<h3 id=\"cursor-behavior\">Cursor behavior</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#deep-paging-with-cursors\" target=\"_blank\">Cursors</a> may break if your script is paging through results at the exact moment the cutover is performed, and you should retry your request once the release is complete. We will post the precise maintenance window to <a href=\"https://status.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://status.crossref.org/</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"filing-issues\">Filing issues</h3>\n<p>Feature requests and bug reports should be filed into the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref issue repository in Gitlab</a> during this testing phase and once the new Elasticsearch-backed API is live in production.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coming-next\">Coming next</h2>\n<p>While we hope the benefits of improved stability and extensibility are as exciting to you as they are to us, &ldquo;feature parity&rdquo; may not be the most thrilling message for our API users. In truth, one of the more exciting aspects of completing this migration is the end of the code freeze we instituted at the start of this effort. Now, we can work on new feature development and a continuous stream of bug fixes. We also improved the automatic test coverage as part of the work, meaning we can deliver features with greater confidence.</p>\n<p>The first new feature we&rsquo;ll be delivering via the REST API will be support for the &ldquo;grants&rdquo; record type, allowing for the retrieval of metadata for <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/grants/\">grants that have been registered with us</a>, now numbering over 20,000 from 8 different funder members. This work is well underway and will be released once we are confident that the new REST API is stable in production.

Some Illustrious projects that had their origins in the R&amp;D group include:</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/labs-logo-ribbon.svg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>DOI Content Negotiation</li>\n<li>Similarity Check (originally CrossCheck)</li>\n<li>ORCID (originally Author DOIs)</li>\n<li>Crossmark</li>\n<li>The Open Funder Registry</li>\n<li>The Crossref REST API</li>\n<li>Linked Clinical Trials</li>\n<li>Event Data</li>\n<li>Grant registration</li>\n<li>ROR</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And for each project that has graduated, there have been several that have not. Some projects were simply designed to gather data. Others just didn’t generate enough interest. You are not truly experimenting if you don’t fail occasionally too.</p>\n<p>Recently we’ve been doing very little experimenting of any kind. Instead, the R&amp;D team has mostly been seconded to the software development team to help them through a period of organizational and process change. We would not have made it through the past two years without their help.</p>\n<p>But now we’re ready to focus on more ‘R’ and less ‘D’. And to that end, we are increasing the size of the team as well. <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/rachael-lammey/\">Rachael Lammey</a> will be joining the team as Head of Strategic Initiatives. She will work alongside our Principal R&amp;D Developers, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/esha-datta/\">Esha Datta</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/dominika-tkaczyk/\">Dominika Tkaczyk</a>. Together they will be able to engage with new communities and immediately start experimenting with ways in which Crossref might be able to address their needs and use-cases.</p>\n<p>We hope to soon add to our list of distinguished R&amp;D project alumni.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rationale--details\">Rationale &amp; details</h2>\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/creature1.svg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>The Crossref R&amp;D group (AKA &ldquo;Labs&rdquo;) has been the incubator of many services that are now in production and which form a fundamental part of Crossref&rsquo;s identity and value. Similarity Check, ORCID, Crossmark, Open Funder Registry, The REST API, Linked Clinical Trials, and Event Data all started as R&amp;D projects. More recently the enhancement of our reference matching infrastructure and the development and launch of ROR were also R&amp;D projects.</p>\n<p>And prior to the formation of the outreach group in 2015, the R&amp;D group also led a critical function engaging with communities that, at the time, Crossref only had tangential connections with: <a href=\"https://pkp.sfu.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">PKP</a>; <a href=\"https://doaj.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DOAJ</a>; funders; and the data and altmetrics communities.</p>\n<p>But since the R&amp;D group merged with the technology team back in 2019, we have done very little &ldquo;R.&rdquo; and very little community engagement of our own. Instead, the R&amp;D team has supported the development team through a period of major cross-cutting projects and organisational change. Dominika has led the REST API rewrite and Esha&mdash;when she is not acting as technical lead on ROR&mdash;has also worked on the API rewrite and has kept Crossref metadata search on its feet. We would not have been able to make it through the past few years without their help.</p>\n<p>Throughout this period, Rachael Lammey has continued the vital work of identifying, engaging with, and advocating for members of our community who we previously didn&rsquo;t even know were members of our community.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/creature2.svg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>The strength of the R&amp;D group was that it combined outreach, product, and development functions. It was not only able to engage with new constituencies, but to quickly experiment with ways in which Crossref might be able to serve them. Previously, members of the R&amp;D team would return from a conference or workshop that no Crossref member had ever attended before with a set of new contacts and ideas for new services and tools. They&rsquo;d form interest groups and develop prototypes. Sometimes the interest groups would lead nowhere and sometimes the prototypes would be discarded. But critically, some of them would turn into the major services and organisations that now form a foundational part of open scholarly infrastructure.</p>\n<p>And this is why it makes so much sense for Rachael to join the R&amp;D team. The group is most effective when it is able to engage with new communities and immediately start experimenting with ways in which Crossref might be able to address their needs and use-cases. Rachael&rsquo;s extensive experience in both product management and outreach&mdash;combined with Esha and Dominika&rsquo;s experience leading development projects&mdash;is exactly what we need to reinvigorate the group and put the R back into R&amp;D.</p>\n<p>To kick off, we are going to be working on some small-ish, discrete projects. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better matching and linking of preprints to published articles;</li>\n<li>Extending our journal title classification to cover all journal and conference proceedings titles; and</li>\n<li>Tools to allow us to community-source structured metadata correction information and feed it back to our members.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/creature3.svg\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>We will consult with and update the community on the kinds of projects we are working on through regular tech updates and a revitalised <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/labs\">Labs</a> area of our website.</p>\n<p>Oh- and we will certainly be designing some new Labs creatures. <br>\n&ndash;G</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"The road ahead: our strategy through 2025","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-road-ahead-our-strategy-through-2025/","published":"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000","description":"This announcement has been in the works for some time, but everything seems to take longer when there is a pandemic going on, including finding time and headspace to plan out our strategy for the next few...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Ginny Hendricks","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>This announcement has been in the works for some time, but everything seems to take longer when there is a pandemic going on, including finding time and headspace to plan out our strategy for the next few years.</p>\n<p>Over the last year or so we have had our heads down addressing how to scale our 20-yr-old system and operation &ndash; and adapting to new ways of working. But we&rsquo;ve also spent time talking to people, forging alliances, looking ahead, and making plans. So we&rsquo;re happy to now let everyone know exactly what we&rsquo;ve been up to lately, what we are heading towards in 2025, and what projects and programs are prioritised on our near-term agenda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">Tl;dr</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy\">new Crossref strategy through 2025</a>, extending the one we published in 2018</li>\n<li>There are now two additional strategic goals, to make six: bolstering our team; living up to POSI</li>\n<li>Good progress has been made in reducing operational and technical debt - a lot of learning too</li>\n<li>We&rsquo;re unblocking stuff to get more done, including expanding R&amp;D (more on that next week)</li>\n<li>We have <a href=\"http://bit.ly/crossref-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\">a new public roadmap</a> 🎉</li>\n<li>Come to next week&rsquo;s mid-year update webinar to hear what&rsquo;s happening and up next.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-emergence-of-a-strategic-agenda\">The emergence of a strategic agenda</h2>\n<p>2018 seems like a decade ago, doesn&rsquo;t it? Back then we set out a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy/archive-2018\">2018-2021 strategic direction&mdash;now archived</a>&mdash;that described four goals: adapt to expanding constituencies; simplify and enrich services; selectively collaborate and partner with others; and improve our metadata quality and comprehensiveness. These themes were formed from the output of a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/scenario-planning-for-our-future\">planning exercise</a> with our board in mid-2017 which tackled scenarios that remain true today, including: the increasing diversity in scholarly publishing (library-publishing, academic-led journals, shifting geographic dominance, etc.); the growth in preprints and other content formats; the sustainability of scholarly publishing (who is funding it and whether that is an expanding or shrinking pool); and the increase in policy and regulation in this space.</p>\n<p>That meeting was the catalyst for embracing openness and a broader set of constituents. It was also decisive about Crossref’s role in this evolving community to focus on our core competencies, defined as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>A reputation as a trusted, neutral one-stop source of metadata and services</li>\n<li>Managing scholarly infrastructure with technical knowledge and innovation</li>\n<li>Convening and facilitating scholarly community collaboration.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you can see how we got to focusing on metadata, services, infrastructure, and broad community collaboration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ahh-2019-such-an-innocent-time\">Ahh, 2019, such an innocent time</h2>\n<p>When we wrote our post at the end of 2019 <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-turning-point-is-a-time-for-reflection/\">A turning point is a time for reflection</a> we highlighted&mdash;with data&mdash;how different the Crossref community is nowadays. The post also linked to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RsqtnHssBkaFNphdWoq20_ewruYP04n8j_dYB9wvphM/edit#slide=id.g65af51c04a_1_238\" target=\"_blank\">the results of our &lsquo;value&rsquo; research project</a> and a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/y8ygwm5\" target=\"_blank\">fact file</a> which had even more hard data and posed the question <strong>Which Crossref initiatives should be top or bottom priorities?</strong>. To answer that, the LIVE19 annual meeting group voted (using betting chips) on priority initiatives, with the following results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Support and implement ROR   <i class='fa fa fa-trophy font-medium font-crossref-yellow'></i>\n</li>\n<li>Metadata best practices and principles</li>\n<li>Support for multiple languages</li>\n<li>Address technical and operational debt</li>\n<li>Schema updates such as JATS and CRediT</li>\n<li>Engagement with funders</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We all know what happened next: the collective health and social trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic. All of us struggled. You all did too. Homeschooling, homeworking, homestaying. Caring for&mdash;and even saying goodbye to&mdash;sick friends and family. Also <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-tribute-to-our-kirsty/\">beloved colleagues</a>. Alongside these unfamiliar new stresses, members were joining in growing numbers, funders kept joining to register grants, conferences went online and we loved them (before then hating them), the number of records we hosted kept going up, and publishing (especially preprints) skyrocketed.</p>\n<p>The plan hasn&rsquo;t actually changed much. Those charts in the 2019 fact file still make for remarkable reading as those same trends continue. We simply haven&rsquo;t had time to update people on where we are with plans. So it&rsquo;s high time we give an update on these priorities as well as contextualise them in longer-term goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-first-some-framing\">But first, some framing</h2>\n<p>The chart below shows the approach we took to organise our thinking. A lot of it isn&rsquo;t new; we have had the current <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/commuinity/about/\">mission statement, key messages</a> (rally, tag, run, play, make), and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/truths/\">truths</a> since the rebranding work in 2015/2016. More recently, we have added POSI to our values, describing the principles and rules by which we operate as a committed open scholarly infrastructure organization.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/crossref-strategic-framework.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</figure>\n<br>\nWe already have a lot of 'words'. So why do we also need a vision statement and where do the goals fit in? In order to prioritize the things we will work on first, we need to be able to track everything to a higher vision, ensuring that everything we do is working toward an agreed destination. When we have organization-wide goals, it means that everyone is clear on the direction, is able to prioritize individual and team work, and can see how their contribution fits in. This, in turn, instills confidence, and motivation - amongst staff as well as members and users.\n<p>Our working vision statement (feedback needed!) is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We envision a rich and reusable open network of relationships connecting research organizations, people, things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can build on forever, for the benefit of society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A vision is, of course, shared. It isn&rsquo;t Crossref-specific but describes the world in which we all want to work together in future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"now-for-those-contextual-six-goals\">Now for those contextual six goals</h2>\n<p>Full details are on the new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy\">strategy</a> page but here&rsquo;s a summary below.</p>\n<div class='shortcode-row '>\n<div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-first-para-highlight\"><p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy/#bolster-the-team\"> <img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/bolster.svg\" alt=\"Bolster the team\" width=\"100%\" align=\"left\" /> </a>\n<br>\nThis goal is all about people, support, culture, and resilience. Not just because we&rsquo;re coming through a panedmic, but also because we&rsquo;re growing and we need to be able to scale and manage growth more purposefully, with appropriate policies, fees, and resources.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy/#live-up-to-posi\"> <img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/live.svg\" alt=\"Live up to POSI\" width =\"100%\" align=\"left\"/> </a>\n<br>\nWe published a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-board-votes-to-adopt-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/\">POSI self-assessment</a> earlier this year and like-minded initiatives are <a href=\"http://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/\" target=\"_blank\">following suit</a>. This is a stated goal because we want to be held publicly accountable to the Principles of Scholarly Infrastructure standards of governance, insurance, and sustainability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/strategy/#engage-with-expanding-communities\"> <img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/engage.svg\" alt=\"Engage with expanding communities\" width=\"100%\" align=\"left\"/> </a>\n<br>\nThis goal centres on growth, strengthening relationships, community facilitation, and content.

And about delivering easy-to-use tools that are critically important for our community.

Expressions of interest will be due Friday, June 25th, 2021.</p>\n<h3 id=\"board-roles-and-responsibilities\">Board roles and responsibilities</h3>\n<p>The role of the board at Crossref is to provide strategic and financial oversight of the organization, as well as guidance to the Executive Director and the staff leadership team, with the key responsibilities being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting the strategic direction for the organization;</li>\n<li>Providing financial oversight; and</li>\n<li>Approving new policies and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The board is representative of our membership base and guides the staff leadership team on trends affecting scholarly communications. The board sets strategic directions for the organization while also providing oversight into policy changes and implementation. Board members have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure sound operations. Board members do this by attending board meetings, as well as joining more specific board committees.</p>\n<p>Crossref’s services provide central infrastructure to scholarly communications. Crossref’s board helps shape the future of our services, and by extension, impacts the broader scholarly ecosystem. We are looking for board members to contribute their experience and perspective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-can-apply-to-join-the-board\">Who can apply to join the board?</h3>\n<p>Any active member of Crossref can apply to join the board. Crossref membership is open to organizations that produce content, such as academic presses, commercial publishers, standards organizations, and research funders. In fact, this year the board has specifically included in the committee’s remit to “propose at least one name from a funder member for the current round of elections.”</p>\n<p>There is a link at the bottom of this post to submit your expression of interest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-expected-of-board-members\">What is expected of board members?</h3>\n<p>Board members attend three meetings each year that typically take place in March, July, and November. Meetings have taken place in a variety of international locations and travel support is provided when needed. Following travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, the board adopted a plan to convene at least one of the board meetings virtually each year and all committee meetings take place virtually. Most board members sit on at least one Crossref committee. Care is taken to accommodate the wide range of timezones in which our board members live.</p>\n<p>While the expressions of interest are specific to an individual, the seat that is elected to the board belongs to the member organization. The primary board member also names an alternate who may attend meetings in the event that the primary board member is unable to. There is no personal financial obligation to sit on the board. The member organization must remain in good standing.</p>\n<p>Board members are expected to be comfortable assuming the responsibilities listed above and to prepare and participate in board meeting discussions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-election\">About the election</h3>\n<p>The board is elected through the “one member, one vote” policy wherein every member organization of Crossref has a single vote to elect representatives to the Crossref board. Board terms are for three years, and this year there are five seats open for election.</p>\n<p>The board maintains a balance of seats, with eight seats for smaller members and eight seats for larger members (based on total revenue to Crossref). This is in an effort to ensure that the diversity of experiences and perspectives of the scholarly community are represented in decisions made at Crossref.</p>\n<p>This year we will elect two of the large member seats (membership tiers $3,900 and above) and three of the small member seats (membership tiers $1,650 and below). You don’t need to specify which seat you are applying for. We will provide that information to the nominating committee.</p>\n<p>The election takes place online and voting will open in September. Election results will be shared at the November board meeting and new members will commence their term in 2022.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-nominating-committee\">About the nominating committee</h3>\n<p>The nominating committee will review the expressions of interest and select a slate of candidates for election.

Publishers&rsquo; value-add includes not just copy editing, formatting, and packaging, but also now creating journal articles for the digital age that are discoverable and well linked to the research corpus. Furthermore, we sense a clear move toward standardization, which goes beyond the structure to introduce standardized semantics: adopting common taxonomies for classifying content in different dimensions.  Our response is to introduce effective, automated and consistent services that capture, and surface metadata throughout the value chain from authoring to publication and search.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; Atypon</cite></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Highwire&rsquo;s publishers are always looking to use the latest DTD (Document Type Definition) for the content to stay up to current standards.

So ensuring correct and quality metadata is the key to optimizing not only the processing (finding the right journal, editor, reviewers) but also to positioning each publication properly.  As the volume of published scientific research increases, article metadata is the way forward &mdash; it  brings &ldquo;order&rdquo; and enables our community to manage this volume.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; Atypon</cite></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Highwire always positions itself as &ldquo;good content in&rdquo; means &ldquo;good content out&rdquo;. This is true for our own content stores. Strong and valid metadata will result in valid and strong deposits. We explain this to all new clients on-boarded with Highwire and the use of current standards and for current client projects where content should/can be enriched through re-load.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; MPS Limited</cite></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Getting our journals to care about metadata is a two step process: First, make sure they understand how metadata will help their journal succeed (i.e. why it matters to them). Second, make it easy for them to produce metadata while minimizing the cost, time, or complexity of their workflow.\nThe first step – making a case for why metadata matters – is often easier than you&rsquo;d think. At the very least, most journal editors understand that metadata, e.g., JATS or DOI registration, is an important signifier of professionalism / prestige. In other words, they see that top journals publish metadata and want the same for their journal.\nFrom a more technical standpoint, metadata is important because that&rsquo;s the format computers understand and, like it or not, the publishing ecosystem relies on computers to deliver all sorts of critical services – such as indexing, archiving, and discoverability. So, if you&rsquo;re not publishing metadata, you&rsquo;re likely missing the benefit of these services. The second step – making it easy to produce metadata – is more difficult. Journal editors generally understand metadata matters but often lack the technical skills or resources necessary to create metadata.\nThis is where a platform, such as Scholastica, can be very helpful. Because platforms work with many journals, they can invest in tools to automate the creation of metadata, reducing costs for all their clients. For example, most platforms offer integrations to support automatic DOI registration. At Scholastica, we&rsquo;re pushing this idea even further with automatic integration to more complicated services such as PubMed Central. By reducing cost and complexity, we can help new or small-budget journals have the same quality metadata normally reserved for large, established journals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; Scholastica</cite></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are sending other publishers&rsquo; metadata to academic libraries and distribution channels.

We are now taking the next steps to further leverage web technology to enhance research output with rich assets ranging from audio and video, datasets, executable code, high-resolution imagery, interactive applications and more.

For more information, see this <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/t/delaying-metadata-manager-sunset-date/2304\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> in the Community Forum.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Hi, I’m Sara, one of the Product Managers here at Crossref. I joined the team in April 2020, primarily tasked with looking after Content Registration mechanisms. Prior to Crossref, I worked on open source software to support scientific research. I’ve learned a lot in the last year about how our community works with us, and I’m looking forward to working more closely with you in the coming year to improve Content Registration tools.</p>\n<p>Just over a year ago, we updated you on the status of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-manager-update/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata Manager</a>. TL;DR: We learned that our approach with the tool wasn’t flexible enough to easily and quickly add other content types or update the input schema, and paused new development. We’re back with another update on Metadata Manager and our strategy for Content Registration user interfaces (UIs) going forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-helper-tools-for-content-registration\">Our helper tools for Content Registration</h2>\n<p>The bulk of content registered with us is done so programmatically; that is, our members’ (or their service providers’) machines talking to our machines using our APIs. But, there are plenty of our members that don’t have the technical expertise to work with us this way. For those members, we provide various helper tools to assist with manual content registration.</p>\n<p>We offer a variety of interfaces for registering many different types of content, including Web Deposit form for most content types, Metadata Manager for journal content, and Simple Text Query to register references. Each of these has its own use cases and limitations, leading to a confusing and inconsistent experience for members who are manually depositing metadata. From our perspective, maintaining this many interfaces in different codebases is inefficient, in part because an update to the schema likely leads to separate updates in each of them. A unified user interface to register content would both improve and simplify the user experience for you, our community, and make updates quicker and more efficient. The original goal of Metadata Manager was to be this unified interface. But we’ve learned that the approach we took was flawed: there have been problems reported by users, and the tool itself isn’t flexible enough to easily and quickly add new content types or support new fields when our input schema changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-new-approach-to-helper-tools\">A new approach to helper tools</h2>\n<p>So we’ve decided to build something new and retire the old. We’ll be focusing on creating a brand new Content Registration user interface that will eventually replace Metadata Manager, the Web Deposit form, and Simple Text Query. And what we’ve learned from our experiences with Metadata Manager and Web Deposit has greatly influenced our strategy going forward. The new tool will:</p>\n<h3 id=\"have-a-community-focus\">Have a Community focus</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Design for small</strong> - Our membership demographic is evolving. A large (and growing) number of our members are very small, often with a single publication and no technical resources. Creating XML can be a barrier to participating in Crossref, and our helper tools are designed to lower that barrier.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility and localization support</strong> - All of our UIs should support major international accessibility guidelines and translation into local languages, to meet the needs of our global membership.</li>\n<li><strong>Open source code</strong> - Build in the open, so that others can contribute. This could mean an entire UI that we haven’t prioritized, or adding a new translation file, or tweaking some CSS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"follow-user-centered-design-processes\">Follow user-centered design processes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unified user interface</strong> - Improve user experience and simplify tools and services by providing members with one place to go to register content via a UI.</li>\n<li><strong>Rapid iteration</strong> - Focus on a technical solution that allows for rapid development of UIs to support new content types and updates to our schema.</li>\n<li><strong>Building the right features for the right users</strong> - The needs of our large members and smaller members are different. Experience has shown us that the core audience for a helper tool is smaller members; we’ll tailor the features to solve the challenges of our smaller members.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"allow-us-to-build-content-for-the-future\">Allow us to build content for the future</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tactical approach to content types</strong> - Quickly build UIs in a strategic order. We can’t build support for every content type at once, so we want to identify and build in the areas of highest impact/lowest effort first.</li>\n<li><strong>Deliberate approach to supported fields</strong> - Not all members will supply metadata for all fields in our schema. Building a UI to support all fields for a specific content type before moving on to another slows progress on that next content type. We’ll identify the most-used and most-useful fields to support first, and add more in a future iteration if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"deprecating-metadata-manager\">Deprecating Metadata Manager</h2>\n<p>In order to free up the resources to develop the new Content Registration UIs, we need to stop doing other things - that means not adding to, supporting, or bug-fixing other Content Registration tools. We’re setting an aggressive goal of sunsetting Metadata Manager by the end of 2021, with a commitment to a smooth transition to our new tool. This means that new members should not start using Metadata Manager. New members who need a helper tool have a few choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>those who use the OJS platform from PKP to host their journals (OJS V3 and above) should use the third party Crossref OJS plugin to register their content.</li>\n<li>other new members should use the Web Deposit form</li>\n<li>current members who are using Metadata Manager may continue to do so, but are advised that we won’t be doing bug fixes or further development on the tool, and that support will be scaled back. If possible, you should transition over to using the Web Deposit form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This wasn’t a decision made lightly, but one made after considering multiple options and all the data available to us about member usage and internal resources.</p>\n<p>To highlight some of the data that led to this decision: the Support team tracks the types of support tickets they handle. In 2020, the 3rd most common ticket type was Metadata Manager-related. But less than 4% of metadata records registered with us are registered using Metadata Manager. Supporting Metadata Manager requires resources disproportionate to the amount of use the tool gets. For comparison, twice as many records are registered using the Web Deposit Form, but it generates far fewer Support tickets. To fix the bugs and issues reported about Metadata Manager requires an equally disproportionate amount of developer resources. So far, we have been unable to free up resources we would need to fix them all. Continuing to maintain this tool is effectively preventing us from building something new that will better meet the needs of our smaller members.</p>\n<p>We know this will surprise and concern some of you, especially heavy users of Metadata Manager. We’re committed to making this a smooth transition, and over the coming months, we’ll provide more guidance to help current members migrate to our other tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"involving-the-community\">Involving the community</h2>\n<p>Building a tool that allows us to create and adapt content registration forms based on example input files is an exciting new approach - one that will allow us to better serve the needs of our smaller members across multiple content types and support those who want to adapt our tools to their own needs. We’ve already begun work on a proof-of-concept tool aligned with this new strategy and I’m excited to drive it to production. As this project develops, we’ll keep in close contact with members, conducting user interviews, feedback sessions, and using usage data to help guide our decision-making on features and design. As we’ll be building in the open, we’ll have prototypes to share along the way as we iterate to produce a tool that will stand the test of time as well as scale to support even more content and members in future.

Making data citation relationship metadata available in Event Data means it will be available in the same format as citations from datasets to articles (which DataCite sends to Event Data) and citations from articles to datasets from Crossref reference metadata (more to come on this later this year). It also means we will convert this information into <a href=\"http://www.scholix.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Scholix</a> format so that it can be harvested and combined with other sets of Scholix-compliant article/data links.

I have a long background in open source, software development, and solving unique problems. One of my earliest computer influences was my father. He wrote software to support scientists in search of things like the top quark, the most massive of all observed elementary particles.</p>\n<p>One day my father came home with over 40 floppy disks, excited to have this cool, free operating system called Linux. Together we installed Linux and ended up with a fully functional computer. Learning and using Linux opened up an entirely new world to me of amazing open-source software that I could use freely. As I enjoyed all this new software now available to me, I tried to fix any bugs or problems I&rsquo;d encounter and report solutions for them to the software developers. It felt great to be able to contribute back so others could benefit.</p>\n<p>Software teams tend to manage their workflow by writing issues, reviewing them to make sure they make sense and have an achievable goal, estimate how much time it will take to complete, and finally––the crucial step––putting the issues in the order in which they should be completed. To manage my work, I’ve always used Jira––a product designed to help teams of all types prioritize work––and for the first time in over a decade, I find myself not using it in my work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"product-development-tracking-with-gitlab\">Product development tracking with GitLab</h2>\n<p>The Crossref team took the decision a few years ago to move all our development and product tracking work via <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab</a>––a commercial open-source product anyone can use to help keep track of software throughout the development life cycle––with an open-by-default policy. Work is tracked using the issues feature of Gitlab. GitLab will host it, so you don&rsquo;t have worry about maintenance and backups. One major drawback I discovered with GitLab, is a lack of maturity when it comes to doing light project management work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is where the trouble begins with GitLab.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the <em>board</em> view of your issues, you can transition your issues from <code>waiting</code>, to <code>in progress</code>, from <code>in progress</code> to <code>done</code>. The problem with this view is its width-restricted, and things like tags on issues, which are used to help categorize, take up valuable vertical space. With enough tags and a long enough subject line, you can only see five issues at a time on a MacBook Pro monitor, for example.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/gitlab-board-view.png\"\nalt=\"GitLab board view graphic\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>In the <em>list</em> view of your issues, you get a clean compact view; the perfect view to order issues. However there&rsquo;s one major flaw, it&rsquo;s paginated. (You know when you&rsquo;re shopping and they make you click to see another page of goods? Yes, like that.) The problem with GitLab&rsquo;s implementation is you can drag and drop issues on a given page, but there is no way to move the issues to another page in the list of results. Additionally, all newly-created issues are added to the end of the list.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/gitlab-list-view.png\"\nalt=\"GitLab list view graphic\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h2>\n<p>I went about finding a solution by visiting GitLab&rsquo;s own public issue page and found that requests requiring user interface (UI) changes would languish; in some cases, they would go years without getting approval. Instead of putting in all the work to open an issue with them, only to have it be discarded or ignored, I decided to look for another way.</p>\n<p>GitLab has an API, what more could I need? I discovered I could log in and get a list of all the issues, by project, and by group. &ldquo;This is perfect!&rdquo;, I thought. I can write my own UI around it. It took three evenings writing a UI that was satisfactory to me. When I started writing javascript to interact with the UI, I learned that the &rsquo;re-ordering of issues&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t actually have an API. Further investigation lead me to the issue tracker where I found an issue by a GitLab employee asking for the same functionality––the ability to re-order issues.</p>\n<p>While in a chatroom for GitLab development, I was genuinely surprised by my experience. There was quick attentive help on locating the file I would need to implement the change, they set up a development environment, and even helped submit tests for my code while I worked on updating documentation and writing a changelog entry. It felt like GitLab must’ve designated an employee to work with the community on submitting improvements. In no time, the API for re-ordering was implemented. After the scheduled monthly release of GitLab rolled out with my new API, I was able to easily re-order issues.</p>\n<p>GitLab&rsquo;s response when help was needed along the way was impressive. Now there is a much easier method for getting work done that everyone can use. It’s rewarding when you can contribute back to the community for all to benefit.</p>\n<p>Is GitLab as polished as Jira? No. Did they embrace me making changes by being open from the start and providing help along the way? Yes. Do I see Jira shifting its culture to match? Unlikely.</p>\n<p>By emulating GitLab, an open organization like Crossref has a shot at encouraging community development.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Stepping up our deposit processing game","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/stepping-up-our-deposit-processing-game/","published":"Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Some of you who have submitted content to us during the first two months of 2021 may have experienced content registration delays.

Some submissions take longer - for example, book registrations with large reference lists, or very large files from larger publishers can take up to 24 to 48 hours to process.</p>\n<p>However, in January and February 2021 we saw content registration delays of several days for all content types and all file sizes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tell-me-more\">Tell me more</h2>\n<p>Januaries and Februaries are usually busy at Crossref. Journal <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/what-can-often-change-but-always-stays-the-same/\">ownership changes hands</a>. Members migrate from one platform to another (and can need to update tens of thousands of their resolution URLs). And, many of you are registering your first issues, books, or conferences of the year. Others of you have heard the calls of <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</a> and <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Initiative for Open Abstracts (I4OA)</a> and are enriching your metadata accordingly (thank you!). Tickets into our support and membership colleagues peak for the year. But did we see significantly more submissions this year?</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/deposit_submissions_19_20_21-2.png\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<p>As you can see, we did see larger-than-normal numbers of submissions in the first two months of the year. For the entire month of January 2021, we received nearly 1 million more submissions into our admin tool deposit queue than we did in January 2020 (2,757,781 in 2021 versus 1,848,261 in 2020). Under normal circumstances, this would lead to an increase in our processing times, so there’s that to consider. But there was also something else at play this year. We desperately needed to upgrade our load balancer, and so we did. Unfortunately, unforeseen at the time, these upgrades caused hiccups in our deposit processing and slowed down submissions even further, building up the number of unprocessed submissions in the queue.</p>\n<p>When we saw the impact this was having we suspended the load balancer work until things were stable again. We also increased the resources serving our queue to bring it back down to normal. To make sure we don&rsquo;t face the same problem again, we have put in better tools to detect trends in queue usage- tools which, in turn, will allow us to anticipate problems in the queue instead of reacting to them after they&rsquo;ve already occurred. And as a longer-term project, we are addressing two decades of technical debt and rearchitecting our system so that our entire system is much more efficient.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gory-technical-details\">Gory technical details</h2>\n<p>As part of our effort to resolve our technical debt, we&rsquo;re looking to transition more of our services to the cloud. To accomplish this, we first needed to upgrade our internal traffic handling capabilities to route things to their new locations better. This upgrade caused some unforeseen and hard to notice problems, like the queue being stalled. Since the queue still showed things in process, it wasn&rsquo;t immediately apparent that things were not processing (normally the processing on the queue will clear a thread if a significant problem occurs).</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://status.crossref.org/incidents/z9hg0xmtnff7\" target=\"_blank\">initially noticed</a> a problem on 5 February and thought we had a fix in place on the 10th. But, we <a href=\"https://status.crossref.org/incidents/c49vrqhftxh5\" target=\"_blank\">again realized</a> on 16 February that the underlying problem had recurred, and we needed a closer investigation.</p>\n<p>For many reasons it took us too much time to realize the connection, until people started complaining.</p>\n<p>While our technical team worked on those load balancer upgrades, some of your submissions lingered for days in the deposit queue. In a few examples, larger submissions took over a week to complete processing. Total pending submissions began to push nearly 100,000, an unusually large backlog. We called an emergency meeting, paused all related work, and dedicated additional time and resources to processing all pending submissions. On 22 February, we completed working through the backlog of pending submissions and new submissions were being processed at normal levels. As we finish up this blog on 2 March, there are less than 3,000 pending submissions in the queue, the oldest of which has been there for less than three hours.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to the entire rationale for what we are doing with the load balancer - which, ironically, was to move some services out of the data centre so that we could free-up resources and scale things more dynamically to match the ebbs and flows of your content registration.</p>\n<p>But before we proceed, we&rsquo;ll be looking at what happened. The bumps associated with upgrading ancient software were expected, so we were looking for side effects. We just didn&rsquo;t look in the right place. And we should have detected that the queues had stalled well before people started to report it to us. A lot of our queue management is still manual. This means we are not adjusting it 24x7. So if something does come in when we are not around, it can exacerbate problems quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it\">What are we going to do about it?</h2>\n<p>In a word: much. We know that timely deposit processing is critical. We can and will do better.</p>\n<p>First off, we have increased the number of concurrently processing threads dedicated to metadata uploads in our deposit queue from 20 to 25. That’s a permanent increase. A million more submissions in a month necessitates additional resources, but that’s only a short-term patch. And we were only able to make this change recently due to some index optimizations we implemented late last year.</p>\n<p>One of the other things that we&rsquo;ve immediately put into place is a better system for measuring trends in our queue usage so that we can, in turn, anticipate rather than react to surges in the queue. And, of course, the next step will be to automate this queue management.</p>\n<p>All this is part of an overall, multi-year effort to address a boat-load of technical debt that we&rsquo;ve accumulated over two decades. Our system was designed to handle a few million DOIs. It has been incrementally poked and prodded to deal with well over a hundred million. But it is suffering.</p>\n<p>Anybody who is even semi-technically-aware might be wondering what all the fuss is about? Why can&rsquo;t we fix this relatively easily? After all, 130 million records&mdash;though a significant milestone for Crossref&mdash;does not in any way qualify as &ldquo;big data.&rdquo; All our DOI records fit onto an average sized micro-SD card. There are open source toolchains that can manage data many, many times this size. We&rsquo;ve occasionally used these tools to load and analyse all our DOI records on a desktop computer. And it has taken in just a few minutes (admittedly using a beefier-than-usual desktop computer). So how can a queue with just 100,000 items in it take so long to process?</p>\n<p>Our scale problem isn&rsquo;t so much about the number of records we process. It is about the 20 years of accumulated processing rules and services that we have in place. Much of it undocumented and the rationale for which has been lost over the decades. It is this complexity that slows us down.</p>\n<p>And one of the challenges we face as we move to a new architecture is deciding which of these rules and services are &ldquo;essential complexity&rdquo; and which are not. For example, we have very complex rules for verifying that submissions contain a correct journal title. These rules involve a lot of text matching and, until they are successfully completed, they block the rest of the registration process.</p>\n<p>But the workflow these rules are designed for is one that was developed before ISSNs were widely deposited and before we had our own, internal title identifiers for items that do not have an ISSN. And so a lot of this process is probably anachronistic. It is not clear which (if any) parts of it are still essential.</p>\n<p>We have layers upon layers of these kinds of processing rules, many of which are mutually dependent and which are therefore not easily amenable to the kind of horizontal scaling that is the basis for modern, scalable data processing toolchains. All this means that, as part of moving to a new architecture, we also have to understand which rules and services we need to move over and which ones have outlived their usefulness. And we need to understand which remaining rules can be decoupled so that they can be run in parallel instead of in sequence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pro tip: Due to the current checks performed in our admin tool, for those of you submitting XML, the most efficient way to do so is by packaging the equivalent of a journal issue&rsquo;s worth of content in each submission (i.e., ten to twelve content items - a 1 MB submission is our suggested file size when striving for efficient processing)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which brings us conveniently back to queues. We did not react soon enough to the queue backing up. We can do much better at monitoring and managing our existing registration pipeline infrastructure. But we are not fooling ourselves into thinking this will deal with the systemic issue.</p>\n<p>We recognize that, with current technology and tools, it is absurd that a queue of 100,000 items should take so long to process. It is also important that people know that we are addressing the root of the issues as well. And that we&rsquo;re not succumbing to the now-legendary anti-pattern of trying to rewrite our system from scratch. Instead we are building a framework that will allow us to incrementally extract the essential complexity of our existing system and discard some of the anachronistic jetsam that has accumulated over the years.</p>\n<p>Content Registration should typically take seconds. We wanted to let you know, that we know, and we are working on it.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Discuss all things metadata in our new community forum","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/discuss-all-things-metadata-in-our-new-community-forum/","published":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000","description":"TL;DR: We have a Community Forum (yay!), you can come and join it here: community.crossref.org.

It is at the very core of what we do and who we are. Our global community now includes publishers, libraries, government agencies, funders, researchers, universities, ambassadors, and more from over 140 countries. We are also actively part of the larger scholarly research community, which includes other <a href=\"http://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/\" target=\"_blank\">open scholarly infrastructure</a> organizations, metadata users and aggregators, open science initiatives, and others with shared aims and values.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-we-mean-by-community\">What do we mean by &lsquo;community&rsquo;?</h2>\n<p>‘Community’ is often one of those words which gets bandied around without much thought given to its meaning. At Crossref, we are aware that expertise lies within our broad, global community and we engage with them (you!) in a variety of ways to ensure that decisions we make are community-led and that what we do, as well as what we don’t do, are in line with the views of our members and developed with your insights and input. We do this via our working groups, committees, ambassador program, beta-testing groups, in-person and online events, webinars, and on-going dialogues and feedback via our support channels and even social media.

It’s more than just attending an event or a webinar, or levelling up to include the use of a service like Crossmark or Similarity Check –– it’s really engaging with us and creating something together of shared value for the scholarly community. As an organization, we’ve been so thrilled that there is a new group dedicated to highlighting community managers and our work.

I wrote in my last blog about <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/community-outreach-in-2020/\">how we have moved our events online</a> and thought about new ways to better connect and engage with our community virtually. One of those ways is our Community Forum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-purpose-of-our-community-forum\">The purpose of our community forum</h2>\n<p>Hosted on the open-source discussion platform <a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">Discourse</a>, you can find our forum at <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">community.crossref.org</a>. The goal of the community forum is to create an inclusive, open space where Crossref members, ambassadors, sponsors, service providers, and others who share a passion for scholarly infrastructure, can connect. This enables collaborative problem-solving, the sharing of expertise and experiences across time zones and languages, and allows members to post questions to be answered by other community members or even our staff. Members of the community engage via creating posts, commenting on existing content in the forum, volunteering for working groups or beta-testing projects, helping to co-create materials that include translations and shared FAQs, giving feedback on new developments, and joining online events and webinars. Throughout these interactions, we expect that those who use the community forum will form relationships –– a collective working together to advance their work with Crossref and shape the future of scholarly infrastructure.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2021/community-forum.png\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<p>When I joined Crossref as Community Manager over three years ago, the idea of a forum had already begun to take shape, but it wasn’t quite there just yet. There was additional research and consultation with the community to be done to check this was the approach we wanted to take.</p>\n<p>This involved speaking to others working in scholarly communications about forums they were involved in running or were an active participant of –– check out the <a href=\"https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">PKP forum</a> for instance if you haven’t already –– and having numerous valuable conversations about successes, potential downfalls, and realistic expectations. The most important –– and commonly cited –– takeaway is that building an online community takes time. We are still at the start of this journey.

We&rsquo;ve collected events for several years and make them openly available via <a href=\"https://api.eventdata.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">an API</a> for anyone to access, as well as creating <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/event-data/transparency/\">open logs</a> of how we found each event. <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/event-data/use/#00632\">Some organisations</a> are already using Event Data and we are keen for more to come on board.</p>\n<p>Last year we gave an <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/events-got-the-better-of-us/\">update on Event Data</a> with apologies for being so quiet and a promise of more information at a later date. It&rsquo;s been some time, so here goes&hellip;</p>\n<p>I joined Crossref in the middle of last year as a Product Manager and was tasked with looking into Event Data. The first thing I found was a large amount of enthusiasm for Event Data, both within Crossref and further afield. The idea of gathering information beyond the metadata deposited by our members is popular, and creates valuable connections between DOIs and a range of other sources. Interest spans the spectrum of academic research, publishing, bibliometrics, and beyond.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I found a project with a very solid, well-built code base but unstable performance. After being put into production in 2018, we didn&rsquo;t provide sufficient support. Coupled with staff changes and other competing priorities, Event Data hasn&rsquo;t had the opportunity to live up to early expectations.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, we have embarked on a plan to make the server infrastructure more robust, improve monitoring, and make sure that the future of Event Data makes the best use of the resources we have without over-stretching. It means working with the community to determine the most essential aspects of Event Data, and providing support where it&rsquo;s needed.</p>\n<p>The steps below are not necessarily sequential and some depend on the completion of work in other parts of Crossref, but they outline the priorities we have for Event Data in 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-plan\">The Plan</h2>\n<h3 id=\"stability\">Stability</h3>\n<p>Since we put in place our original Event Data infrastructure, the amount of incoming data has grown, and at an ever-increasing rate. In 2017 we were creating 2 million new events per month, that number is now over 20 million. We have known for some time that we need to refresh the infrastructure, but didn&rsquo;t have the resources to move forward: now we do.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the plan we will renew the server infrastructure that underpins Event Data. Maybe not a headline-grabbing move, but the aim is to reduce downtime and pull in missing data. Through improving our monitoring and shortening the response time when things go wrong, we will be able to ensure that events are added on a regular basis and the API can reliably handle requests.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve made the first steps in this direction by upgrading our API infrastructure and making some other tweaks to improve performance. There is still work to do, but we&rsquo;ve already seen a <a href=\"https://status.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">significant improvement in performance</a> with nearly &gt;99.99% uptime in December.</p>\n<h3 id=\"consolidation\">Consolidation</h3>\n<p>The second component of the plan is to review performance and data quality. We will evaluate the event sources, update artefacts (such as the lists of publisher landing pages and news websites, and review performance reporting. This will help us to have a better understanding of Event Data in its current form: if the stability component is about improving what comes in and goes and out, this part will give us increased confidence in what Event Data already contains.</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-roadmap\">Future roadmap</h3>\n<p>While the two steps above are being carried out, we will revisit the applications of Event Data and talk to organizations that currently use it or have expressed an interest. These conversations will feed into future development in which we will evaluate new sources and other ways to optimize the service.</p>\n<p>Central to the roadmap will be continued support of the data citation endpoint in <a href=\"http://www.scholix.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Scholix</a> format, which we run in close collaboration with DataCite. Additionally, we will add new data from <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/structural-metadata/relationships/\">relationships</a> between Crossref works, for example a preprint is matched to a journal article, or where there are corrections, retractions, or translations of works.</p>\n<p>We expect to continue supporting the current sources of events and where there are organizations with either a strong interest in a particular source or a database of events that they can send directly, we are keen to build collaborations. Event Data, like everything that Crossref does, is a community-based effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"staying-in-touch\">Staying in touch</h2>\n<p>To join the conversation about Event Data and keep informed, head over to our <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/c/crossref-services/event-data/17\" target=\"_blank\">Community pages</a>.

She was a huge part of Crossref, our culture, and our lives for the last twelve years.</p>\n<p>Kirsty Meddings is a name that almost everyone in scholarly publishing knows; she was part of a generation of Oxford women in publishing technology who have progressed through the industry, adapted to its changes, spotted new opportunities, and supported each other throughout. We hope this post will do justice to her memory in our profession.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kirstys-early-career\">Kirsty&rsquo;s early career</h2>\n<p>After completing her degree in English and Spanish American Literature at Warwick University, Kirsty started her career in scholarly communications and publishing at Blackwell’s Information Services. She was there for a year before joining CatchWord, an online journal start-up, in 1998, as Electronic Publisher and Account Manager and in 1999 was promoted to the new role of Library Relations Manager.</p>\n<p>CatchWord was acquired by Ingenta and Kirsty moved into product management working on integrating the CatchWord and Ingenta platforms and launching IngentaConnect in 2004. Ingenta became Publishing Technology in 2005 and Kirsty was Product Development Manager working with engineering, business development, and users on developing online products and services. She was also involved in a range of community initiatives including COUNTER, KBART, and ICEDIS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"joining-crossref\">Joining Crossref</h2>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/kirsty-meddings/\"><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/staff/kirsty_720px.jpg\"\nalt=\"Kirsty&amp;rsquo;s professional headshot\" width=\"50%\"/></a><figcaption>\n<p>Kirsty&rsquo;s professional headshot</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>She was an early pioneer in electronic and online publishing - an innovator who understood scholarly publishing, technology, libraries, and people - a powerful combination. And Crossref was quick to offer her a role.</p>\n<p>In Kirsty’s introduction to Crossref she was described by the recruiter as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An experienced and highly capable individual with a solid background in product development, marketing and customer service issues related to the supply of scholarly electronic content from publishers to library and end user audiences. A good communicator and team worker with sound technical understanding and an excellent grasp of publishing industry issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This adequately captures Kirsty’s impressive professional achievements, but not her personality. Kirsty was a Product Manager at Crossref for 12 years and was a valued and loved friend and colleague. Committed to Crossref&mdash;its values and people&mdash;she was funny, human, and always asked tough questions.</p>\n<p>She joined us on October 27th, 2008 as our first Product Manager and the third UK employee. In her time at Crossref, Kirsty made a major impact, working on a range of important projects and services - particularly new, innovative services. Not long after she started at Crossref, she wrote a “day in the life” profile for the journal Serials that perfectly captures what it was like in 2009 at Crossref Oxford (there were three of us in Oxford and only ten total staff at Crossref): <em>Meddings, K., 2009. Mini-profile: a day in the life of a product manager. Serials, 22(1), pp.5–6. DOI: <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1629/225\" target=\"_blank\">http://doi.org/10.1629/225</a></em></p>\n<p>Her own biography, on her staff <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/kirsty-meddings/\">page</a>, states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kirsty Meddings has been involved in a diverse set of initiatives that have kept her busy since 2008. She has spent most of her career in scholarly communications, in a variety of marketing and product development roles for intermediaries and technology suppliers. She speaks conversational geek and competent publishing, and is working towards fluency in both.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See? Funny!</p>\n<h2 id=\"professional-achievements\">Professional achievements</h2>\n<p>Kirsty started out working on CrossCheck, now Similarity Check, the plagiarism screening service that launched in 2008. The service was in need of some attention and better organization - Kirsty got stuck in, whipped it into shape and it has gone on to be one of Crossref’s most widely-adopted services. <a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.ismte.org/resource/resmgr/eon/august_2011.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">This article</a> that Kirsty wrote for ISMTE’s publication, EON, remains useful nearly 10 years after it was written! Kirsty successfully managed the partnership with Turnitin (starting as iParadigms), the technical provider for Similarity Check, for many years. Colleagues there are mourning her loss too.</p>\n<p>Kirsty was instrumental in launching Crossmark, which became a production service in 2012. After a few changes of hands, she resumed work on the service in recent years, and announced <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/encouraging-even-greater-reporting-of-corrections-and-retractions/\">the removal of Crossmark fees</a> to better support uptake in 2020.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/news/2016-05-17-crossref-publishers-deliver-win-for-clinical-trial-openness/\">The addition of clinical trial information to the Crossref metadata</a> was a community-driven initiative, developed from the concept of <a href=\"https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2014/01/31/threaded-publications-one-step-closer/\" target=\"_blank\">threaded publications</a>. There were/are lots of moving parts in this initiative, and in many ways it was one of the precursors to the idea of the Research Nexus: linking via metadata and relationships to provide a clearer picture of the ecosystem that exists around a research object.</p>\n<p>What was once FundRef (ahh, those logos!) has matured into the Open Funder Registry under Kirsty’s stewardship. In collaboration with Elsevier, the registry has grown from <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/news/2013-05-28-crossrefs-fundref-launches-publishers-and-funders-track-scholarly-output/\" target=\"_blank\">an initial 4,000 funders</a>, to over 25,000 and we can see <a href=\"http://api.crossref.org/works?filter=has-funder:t&amp;rows=0\" target=\"_blank\">over 5 million works</a> registered with Crossref that are linked to at least one funder. More recently, Kirsty was the Product Manager for the registration of research grants with Crossref, working with our Funder Advisory Group, and she was starting to work with CDL and DataCite to absorb the Funder Registry into ROR.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Kirsty launched our first ever dashboard for member best practice. She led the development and design of Participation Reports and the decision of which checks would be most important for the scholarly community to assess. This has quickly become one of Crossref’s most valuable and used tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"public-speaking\">Public speaking</h2>\n<p>Kirsty always spoke with authority across a range of topics, appearing totally calm even if she was nervous. Among many talks, she spoke at the STM seminar on <a href=\"https://www.stm-assoc.org/events/publication-ethics-and-research-integrity/\" target=\"_blank\">Publication Ethics and Research Integrity</a>, ISMTE, UKSG, ALPSP seminars, the COPE Forum, ran numerous CrossCheck, CrossMark, FundRef and TDM webinars, and a recent online LIVE event.</p>\n<p>She was a frequent presenter at many of Crossref annual meetings, and enjoyed the opportunity to meet and catch up with our members, the board, and the community (many of whom always ask after her). Checking in after conferences on who said what, who’s moving where, what feedback we had, and picking up on opportunities for further collaboration were all things that we looked forward to sharing.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are heartbroken here at UKSG about the death of Kirsty - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kmeddings?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@kmeddings</a> - she was always such a staunch supporter of everything we did from the earliest days of her career.

She was also a legend at the dinners, on the dance floor, and in the bar. At the 2019 conference she tallied the votes at the quiz night - Kirsty loved a quiz! We had an all-staff end-of-year quiz via zoom last week and it was just not the same without her.</p>\n<p>Here are <a href=\"https://www2.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?searchfrom=header&amp;q=Kirsty&#43;meddings\" target=\"_blank\">Kirsty&rsquo;s slides on SlideShare</a>, some <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=kirsty&#43;meddings&#43;Crossref&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf78Soq9DtAhVTolwKHXzhBOoQ_AUoA3oECAYQBQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=707\" target=\"_blank\">videos of Kirsty&rsquo;s talks on YouTube</a>, and her <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9205-2956\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID record</a> which lists her published works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strong-friendships\">Strong friendships</h2>\n<p>One of the most rewarding experiences of working at Crossref is meeting up with the whole team and with our members. Jetlag, hunting out coeliac-friendly food, staying up far too late chatting, trying to fit in exploring bits of cities around board and other meetings, presenting, organizing, thinking, laughing (I’m sure to the annoyance of other plane passengers)&mdash;these experiences were all part and parcel of working with Kirsty, and where many of us cemented connections with her.</p>\n<p>We started a <a href=\"https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/DY47xRTo\" target=\"_blank\">message board</a> and within days it was populated with numerous stories, poems, and photos from so many friends and colleagues on whom Kirsty made such a lasting and loving impression.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/DY47xRTo\"><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/kirsty-messages.jpg\"\nalt=\"Kirsty&amp;rsquo;s message board\" width=\"25%\"/></a><figcaption>\n<p>Kirsty&rsquo;s message board</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It’s impossible to capture someone’s character in a blog, but some of the words that carry across the messages that people have shared are empathy, compassion, honesty, intelligence, brilliance, sincerity, laughter, human, passion, openness, and fun. We’ll miss her immensely.</p>\n<p>Kirsty was somewhat of an expert in grief. She lost her first husband, James Culling, to leukemia in December 2012, leaving her a widow with two sons, Dan, 7 at the time, and Luke, just 6-months old. A few years later, through the charity Widowed And Young (WAY), she met Martin Eggleston. Martin and his daughter Amy joined Kirsty, Dan, and Luke, and they created a very happy blended family. Some of us went to their wedding and it was an incredible event full of love and laughter - and of course music. Always music.</p>\n<p>Kirsty represented us, along with Rachael, at the funeral of another colleague last year, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/rest-in-peace-christine-hone/\">Christine Hone</a>, in Amsterdam. Kirsty helped all of us get through the grief then. And because she made it okay to grieve and to talk about grief, it is heartbreaking and also comforting that she is indirectly helping us all now to be better able to handle her own death.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-we-can-honour-kirstys-memory\">How we can honour Kirsty’s memory</h3>\n<p>We heard that Kirsty’s last words were “I’m listening”. Which is just so fitting. She was always ready with an ear, a shoulder to support us all, and indeed she demanded that we express ourselves honestly.</p>\n<p>If you want to share memories of Kirsty, you can join others who have done so <a href=\"https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/DY47xRTo\" target=\"_blank\">on the message board</a> or just take a few minutes to read through.</p>\n<p>And there is a <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/kirsty-meddings\" target=\"_blank\">justgiving page</a> in memory of Kirsty for Maggie&rsquo;s Oxford, a branch of a cancer support charity who helped her and her family through James&rsquo;s death and is now helping her family again.</p>\n<p>Professionally, Kirsty made major contributions at Crossref and in scholarly communications in general. More importantly, she had a profound impact on a personal level with many people. Our thoughts are with Martin, Dan, Amy, and Luke, and also with Kirsty’s mum Val, her brother Colin, her in-laws, her close friends, and all the people who&mdash;like the rest of us&mdash;are better for knowing her, and will never forget her.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Fast, citable feedback: Peer reviews for preprints and other content types","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/fast-citable-feedback-peer-reviews-for-preprints-and-other-content-types/","published":"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Crossref has supported depositing metadata for preprints since 2016 and peer reviews since 2018.

Now we are putting the two together, in fact we will permit peer reviews to be registered for any <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/content-types-intro/\">content type</a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, peer reviews can be registered for journal articles, but that means that they can only be related to some of the content our members deposit. Preprints, books, chapters, working papers, dissertations, and a host of other works can also be registered with Crossref. A number of these frequently undergo some form of review and many of our members and voices in the community have called for us to widen the net on peer reviews, including journal publishers, book publishers, review platforms, and preprint servers. We&rsquo;ve listened and taken action, and from now on Crossref members can add <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/structural-metadata/relationships/\">relationship metadata</a> that links peer reviews to any content type. The metadata will also contain <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/schema-library/markup-guide/peer-reviews/\">the type of review</a>, stating whether it is a referee report, author response, or community comment, etc. This allows accurate reporting on whether the peer review is happening within a traditional editorial process or elsewhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reviews-for-preprints\">Reviews for preprints</h2>\n<p>In the last decade there has been an increase in the number of disciplines using preprints. Since enabling registration of preprint metadata, it has become our fastest-growing content type. Preprints, working papers, and other forms of early publication help to accelerate dissemination of the latest research and discovery. They can also promote discussion on important topics, and help authors to improve papers before an editorial decision for journal publication. During the COVID-19 pandemic, preprints have become invaluable for speeding the publication of vital research and case studies.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, preprints do not undergo formal review and editorial approval, leading to concerns about the dissemination of false information. While the issue of misinformation in preprints has been discussed for some time, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought it more sharply into focus. Organizations that post preprints need to balance the benefits of rapid dissemination with promoting their responsible use.</p>\n<p>To support the feedback process, preprint servers along with a growing number of other platforms and services offer scholars the opportunity to post public comments on preprints. By doing this, they give extra context for readers, provide suggestions for authors, and raise awareness of work that could be flawed or too preliminary.</p>\n<p>Another growing trend is journal publishers adopting editorial processes that involve preprint-first options and open peer review. As Dr. Stephanie Dawson from ScienceOpen says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;We have long believed in rewarding reviewers by assigning Crossref DOIs to their open reviews to make them citable objects and we were one of the first users of Crossref&rsquo;s peer review schema. However, a large percentage of the articles reviewed on ScienceOpen are publicly available preprints. The <em>UCL Open: Environment</em> journal hosted on the platform, for example, is based on a workflow of open peer review of preprints. Our customers, editors, reviewers and authors are therefore extremely happy that these reviews can now also be assigned a Crossref peer review DOI for more accountability and transparency in scholarly publishing.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At Crossref, we&rsquo;re continually looking to support more content types and relations between them to build trust, support reproducibility and increase discoverability of content. This is another small step in building the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-research-nexus-better-research-through-better-metadata/\">research nexus</a> and we look forward to working with members depositing peer reviews of preprints.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"404: Support team down for essential maintenance","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/404-support-team-down-for-essential-maintenance/","published":"Fri, 04 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"2020 has been a very challenging year, and we can all agree that everyone needs a break.

We’ve seen over 337 million requests to our REST API on average per month in 2020, a 9% increase over 2019 (and over 600 million total metadata queries on average per month across all our APIs and services).</p>\n<p>Of course, all this activity brings an increasing number of requests for help and support. Since the start of 2020, we have answered almost 24,000 support tickets from the community. Sometimes these just need a quick answer or a link to our documentation. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a straightforward new member application or a routine query. But sometimes a prospective member needs a lots of advice, sometimes a long-standing member or user needs in-depth investigations and consultancy. Sometimes the request highlights a problem in one of our systems that needs input from our product and development colleagues. But either way, it’s keeping our small team of five full-time employees very busy.</p>\n<p>Vanessa <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/community-outreach-in-2020/\">wrote</a> earlier in the year about how our Community Outreach team has changed its working practices this year. As Head of Member Experience I’ve been incredibly impressed by the way our membership, support and billing staff have done the same - remaining really focused on the needs of the Crossref community while (at the same time) balancing this with the demands of working from home, childcare, home-schooling, and supporting those affected by the pandemic in their own community. Isaac’s thoughtful <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/t/my-first-week-working-from-home-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic/1236\" target=\"_blank\">post on our forum</a> about his first week working at home because of the pandemic really highlighted some of these challenges.</p>\n<p>We take work/life balance seriously at Crossref. We want to make sure that we’re are able to continue to help the Crossref community effectively in 2021, but are also able to continue to look after ourselves, our families, and our own communities in this difficult time. We all hope that 2021 will be a very different year, but there’s still likely to be disruption ahead for all of us, and one thing is sure: there will continue to be plenty more requests coming in for our small team to stay on top of in the meantime.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we want to make sure that our support staff are able to properly rest and recharge during what is a holiday period for many of us coming up. We’ll be operating with just one person each on the technical support and membership support side between 23rd December and 3rd January. This means that while we’ll be able to answer urgent queries, <strong>non-urgent questions will be left unanswered until 4th January. And we’ll not take on any new members between 21st December and 3rd January too.</strong></p>\n<p>We know many of you will be continuing to work during this period. If you have a non-urgent question, do take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/\">support documentation</a> in the meantime, or see if other members (or our amazing Ambassadors) are able to <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">help on our forum</a>. If you can’t find what you’re looking for and it&rsquo;s urgent, we hope that the limited staff who are on call will still be able to help you out.</p>\n<p>Colleagues in the US have recently celebrated their Thanksgiving, and I remain enormously thankful for our team here at Crossref, and for you all in the scholarly community for your enthusiasm for working together collectively to help the world find, cite, link, assess, and reuse scholarly content. We all really appreciate your patience while we reset ready for 2021. Happy Holidays!</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Crossref’s Board votes to adopt the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-board-votes-to-adopt-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/","published":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"TL;DR On November 11th 2020, the Crossref Board voted to adopt the “Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure” (POSI).

POSI is a list of sixteen commitments that will now guide the board, staff, and Crossref’s development as an organisation into the future. It is an important public statement to make in Crossref’s twentieth anniversary year. Crossref has followed principles since its founding, and meets most of the POSI, but publicly committing to a codified and measurable set of principles is a big step. If <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-turning-point-is-a-time-for-reflection/\">2019 was a reflective turning point</a>, and mid-2020 was about <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/meet-the-new-crossref-executive-director/\">Crossref committing to open scholarly infrastructure</a> and collaboration, this is now announcing a very deliberate path. And we’re just a little bit giddy about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/geoffrey-bilder/\">Here is a picture of me being “giddy.”</a></p>\n<p>If you just want to see the principles that the board has endorsed, you can see them here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H</a></p>\n<p>But if you also want some background and want to understand some of the implications of Crossref adopting the principles, read on…</p>\n<p>Warning - this is a long post.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2 id=\"background-and-origins\">Background and Origins</h2>\n<p>Some of you may be surprised that we’ve done this - simply because you always assumed we operated under these principles anyway. And we have. Mostly.</p>\n<p>The “Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure” were largely inspired by a set of uncodified rules and norms that Crossref had been operating under for years. So how did we get to this circular situation where we are making a big announcement about adopting something we have largely been doing anyway?</p>\n<p>Six years ago I met with Cameron Neylon and Jennifer Lin when they were still at PLOS and we decided that we wanted to write a blog post about&hellip;</p>\n<p>Well, it doesn’t really matter.</p>\n<p>We never finished writing that blog post because we got distracted by an issue that we kept seeing which was that services that the scholarly community depended on were increasingly taking directions that seemed antithetical to the community’s interests.</p>\n<p>We were concerned because the scholarly community was becoming increasingly distrustful of infrastructure services. We wondered if there were any practices that we could point to that might mitigate the risk of infrastructure being co-opted and that would help build trust. Fortunately, we had two great models to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crossref, which had a set of informal rules and norms that it had followed since its founding (e.g., transparency of operations, being business-model neutral, one member one vote).</li>\n<li>ORCID, an organisation that was spun-out of Crossref and which had adopted <a href=\"https://orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid/principles\" target=\"_blank\">a written set of principles</a>, based largely on codifying practices that they had seen at Crossref.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so we wrote these practices up and added a few that we thought were missing. And we posted a different blog post to the one we had originally planned. It was titled “<a href=\"https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/\" target=\"_blank\">The Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructures.</a>” And the blog post became <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;q=%E2%80%9CPrinciples&#43;for&#43;Open&#43;Scholarly&#43;Infrastructures.%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">popular</a>. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWPZkZ180Ho\" target=\"_blank\">And we did a bunch of talks about the Principles</a>. And, much to our surprise, POSI has influenced the directions and policies of a number of organisations and initiatives since, including <a href=\"https://sparcopen.org/our-work/good-practice-principles-for-scholarly-communication-services/\" target=\"_blank\">SPARC</a>, <a href=\"https://investinopen.org/blog/invest-in-open-infrastructure-launches/\" target=\"_blank\">Invest in Open Infrastructure</a>, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/OPEN_Designing-sustainable-data-institutions_ODI_2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data Institute</a>, <a href=\"http://oaswitchboard.org\" target=\"_blank\">OA Switchboard</a>, and others.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, community organizations and likeminded community members helped further develop the implementation of POSI through discussions at FORCE11 and through additional blog posts and books. Some, like Dryad and ROR, started to work to align their organizational structure to embrace POSI.</p>\n<p>And this left Crossref in a strange position. Although we were largely the inspiration for these Principles - we ourselves had never codified and adopted them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"motivations-why-now\">Motivations. Why Now?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"because-it-is-the-right-thing-to-do-for-those-that-currently-depend-on-crossref\">Because it is the right thing to do for those that currently depend on Crossref</h3>\n<p>It is a healthy thing for the organisation to do. Adopting these principles strengthens Crossref’s governance. After twenty years, Crossref infrastructure has become critical to a broad segment of the community. As our membership profile changes, and as our broader stakeholder community expands, we need to explicitly evolve our governance to reflect stakeholders. And it would be irresponsible to continue to have our governance guided by a set of informal conventions. Particularly in the context of a global political period where we’ve seen the informal operating conventions and policy understandings of at least two major democracies ignored or discarded.</p>\n<h3 id=\"because-it-could-help-make-the-creation-of-new-sustainable-open-scholarly-infrastructure-easier-and-less-expensive\">Because it could help make the creation of new, sustainable, open scholarly infrastructure easier and less expensive</h3>\n<p>There is a lot of new interest in open scholarly infrastructure. New infrastructure services and systems are being proposed almost every month. Many of them seek extensive advice and consulting from Crossref. A subset of these are incubated through Crossref. And a subset of these become Crossref services. Others are spun out as separate organisations (e.g., <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID</a>) or were specifically initiated as collaborations (e.g., <a href=\"https://ror.org\" target=\"_blank\">ROR</a>).</p>\n<p>Our experience has been that the vast majority of work involved in these infrastructure projects was in establishing trust amongst the stakeholder community. We think that Crossref adopting the principles will help to address fundamental questions about accountability and sustainability that are inevitably raised when a new constituency approaches Crossref with an idea for collaborating on a new or existing infrastructure service. In short, adopting the principles will make future collaboration easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adopting-the-principles-plus-ça-change\">Adopting the Principles: Plus ça change</h2>\n<p>The Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI) proposes three areas that an Open Infrastructure organisation can address in order to garner the trust of the broader scholarly community: accountability (governance), funding (sustainability), and protection of community interests (insurance).</p>\n<p>POSI proposes a set of concrete commitments that an organisation can make to build trust in each of these areas. There are 16 such commitments. Of these 16 commitments, Crossref is already completely or partially meeting the requirements of 15. And adopting the 16th commitment just formalises a direction Crossref has been heading toward for several years.</p>\n<p>Critically, “adopting” POSI does not mean that we have to instantly meet all of the criteria. After all, when ORCID adopted its principles, it didn’t meet <em>any</em> of them. They were adopted to make a statement of intent. And they were publicly adopted so that the community could measure the organisation&rsquo;s progress as well as to allow the community to detect if ORCID started to stray from its stated intentions.</p>\n<p>Adopting the principles is akin to adopting a mission statement or a vision statement. It is an aspirational guide, not a description of the <em>status quo</em>.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the principles are more concrete than a mission or vision statement, and this makes them easier to measure.</p>\n<p>It is also important to note that the criteria are designed to balance each other. So, for example, one would not want to change the governance or business model to better support the mission if doing so would also threaten the sustainability of the organisation.</p>\n<p>And finally, meeting a commitment is an ongoing process - it is not a one-off event. The organisation needs to keep measuring their performance against the principles in order to make sure that they have not inadvertently regressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implications\">Implications</h2>\n<p>Before adopting the principles, we did a candid self-audit to see which ones we thought we currently met and which ones we still needed to work on.</p>\n<p>The three areas and sixteen commitments that are proposed in POSI are all designed to ensure that an infrastructure can not be co-opted by a particular party or interest group.</p>\n<p>And the last area, “Insurance,” is the backstop that makes sure that, if some in the community feel that the infrastructure organisation has gone in a radically wrong direction, they can recreate the infrastructure as it was when they were comfortable with it, and they will not be hindered by practices or policies that lock them into the existing organisation.</p>\n<p>This “insurance” is very much inspired by Crossref. Crossref itself was built, in part, to make sure that publishers were not locked into platforms and that journals and societies were not locked into publishers. Using the indirect Crossref DOI linking mechanism ensures that content can move between platforms and publishers without breaking vital citation links. Moving between platforms or publishers is never easy. And it isn’t cheap. But using Crossref DOIs for citation links at least makes it possible.</p>\n<p>Crossref has an extra insurance level as well. It is built on the DOI and Handle infrastructure. If Crossref were to take a direction that some of its members found unacceptable, those members could join another DOI Registry agency more amenable to them. It wouldn’t be easy. It wouldn’t be cheap. But it would be possible.</p>\n<p>And this knowledge helps keep Crossref grounded and attuned to the needs and concerns of its members. We know that our members are not “trapped” with us. We don’t take lightly the trust placed in us. And we know that there is trust still to build with various corners of our community. And it is this knowledge that helps keep us from developing the disdainful, take-it-or-leave-it, attitude that can be the cliché characteristic of infrastructure organisations.</p>\n<p>So the fundamental, overarching goal of POSI is to set out principles that ensure that the stakeholders of an infrastructure organisation have a clear say in setting its agenda and priorities and that, in extremis, the stakeholders can leave and create an alternative infrastructure if the original organisation becomes unresponsive, hostile, or disappears.</p>\n<p>As we look at how Crossref currently maps to the principles, please keep in mind three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If we have marked something as green, that doesn’t mean we think we do this perfectly. It simply means that we already have internal processes that focus on this commitment and we have evidence that these processes have thus far been working.</li>\n<li>The fact that something is green and has “thus-far been working” does not mean that we should rest easy. We could regress. Our processes need to be able to detect and address regressions.</li>\n<li>The commitments are supposed to be balanced. So we don’t want to do something to turn something green if it has an irreversible impact on another commitment. So, for example, we should not address a shortfall in the contingency fund by generating revenue in a way that ultimately hurts Crossref’s mission.</li>\n<li>The implication of #3 above is that it may take us some time to meet all of the commitments. But again, the community can measure our progress against meeting the commitments.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"so-how-does-crossref-currently-meet-posi\">So how does Crossref currently meet POSI?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"governance\">Governance</h3>\n<pre><code>🟢 Coverage across the research enterprise.\n🟢 Non-discriminatory membership\n🟢 Transparent operations\n🟢 Cannot lobby\n🟢 Living will\n🟢 Formal incentives to fulfil mission &amp; wind-down\n🔴 Stakeholder Governed\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"sustainability\">Sustainability</h3>\n<pre><code>🟢 Time-limited funds are used only for time-limited activities.\n🟢 Goal to generate surplus\n🟡 Goal to create contingency fund to support operations for 12 months\n🟢 Mission-consistent revenue generation\n🟢 Revenue based on services, not data\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"insurance\">Insurance</h3>\n<pre><code>🟢 Available data (within constraints of privacy laws)\n🟡 Patent non-assertion\n🟡 Open source\n🟡 Open data (within constraints of privacy laws)\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"governance-1\">Governance</h3>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>If an infrastructure is successful and becomes critical to the community, we need to ensure it is not co-opted by particular interest groups.

How do we ensure that the system is run “humbly”, that it recognises it doesn’t have a right to exist beyond the support it provides for the community and that it plans accordingly? How do we ensure that the system remains responsive to the changing needs of the community?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>In the area of governance, Crossref clearly meets six of the seven criteria listed. We will discuss these first.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-coverage-across-the-research-enterprise\">🟢 Coverage across the research enterprise</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>it is increasingly clear that research transcends disciplines, geography, institutions and stakeholders. The infrastructure that supports it needs to do the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref includes members who publish in the STM, HSS and Professional spheres. There are still some gaps in our coverage (e.g., monographs, law), but this is not through policy or lack of trying.</p>\n<p>Crossref has members in 139 countries and has agreements with people in 150 countries. However note that geographic diversity is <em>not</em> the same as language diversity. Although we have members in many countries, the vast majority of our registered content is still in English. This does not reflect the trends in research outputs. We still need to do a lot of work to support non-English publications and non-English speaking members. But we have already identified this as a priority and are working on a number of initiatives to better support research communication in languages other than English.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-non-discriminatory-membership\">🟢 Non-discriminatory membership</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>we see the best option as an “opt-in” approach with a principle of non-discrimination where any stakeholder group may express an interest and should be welcome. The process of representation in day to day governance must also be inclusive with governance that reflects the demographics of the membership</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>It is first worth noting that “non-discriminatory” does not mean that we cannot have standards, obligations, and rules that all members of Crossref have to adhere to. It simply means that said rules are clear and that we apply them uniformly.</p>\n<p>Crossref has always had catholic membership criteria. Although we have until now historically defined ourselves as a primarily “publisher” organisation, we define “publisher” loosely as anybody who produces content that commonly references or is referenced by scholarly literature. Historically, this has included NGOs, IGO’s, standards bodies, institutional archives, and professional publishers. More recently it has expanded to include preprint archives and funders.</p>\n<p>The requirements for joining Crossref are few. We admit any applicant who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agrees to the obligations of membership.</li>\n<li>Can pay the fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In practice we have historically had a policy of rejecting individuals as members. But even this is probably a pointless distinction as many of our members are “organisations” consisting of one person.</p>\n<p>And fundamental to Crossref’s governance is that a member’s influence in the governance of Crossref is not tied to the level of financial investment they make in the organisation. All members have the same single vote. All board members have one vote.</p>\n<p>Recently, we have also made changes to our governance and election process. The first to introduce contested elections for the board. The second to ensure that board membership was proportionally balanced amongst the membership tiers. Even as recently as 2017, when the Board established a Governance Committee, the idea of weighting votes to membership tiers was roundly rejected - on principle.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that we can relax on this point. For example, as more funders and institutions join Crossref, we will need to make sure that our governance reflects that. We talk about this more in the section on governance.</p>\n<p>Some will also point out that our fees are themselves a form of discrimination as they can still be an insurmountable barrier to some in the community. We understand this and, without trying to make light of or dismiss the situation, we are also confident that we are constantly looking at ways to lower the barrier-to-entry for joining Crossref. Our fees have gone steadily down since we were founded and we are constantly reviewing them to try and make them more equitable. We have created a category of sponsoring organisations to defray the costs of membership. We collaborate closely with organisations like PKP to try and build tools and services that make participation in Crossref easier and less expensive.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-transparent-operations\">🟢 Transparent operations</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>achieving trust in the selection of representatives to governance groups will be best achieved through transparent processes and operations in general (within the constraints of privacy laws).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref has transparent finances and a transparent governance process. Much of this is simply a byproduct of the regulations governing non-profits with tax exempt status in the US and our specific registration as a non-profit membership association in New York State.</p>\n<p>Until fairly recently, the obvious exception to this was Crossref’s use of pre-picked slates in board elections, but we have since improved this with an open election process.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-cannot-lobby\">🟢 Cannot lobby</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>the community, not infrastructure organisations, should collectively drive regulatory change. An infrastructure organisation’s role is to provide a base for others to work on and should depend on its community to support the creation of a legislative environment that affects it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref has never lobbied. Partly this is a byproduct of our commitment to be business-model neutral as most lobbying efforts in the industry seem to center around promoting the views held by members who share a business model.</p>\n<p>But also, Crossref has never lobbied on its own behalf. We have always relied on our members and the community to point out and promote Crossref if there is any area of legislative policy that the Crossref infrastructure could help with.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-living-will\">🟢 Living will</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>a powerful way to create trust is to publicly describe a plan addressing the condition under which an organisation would be wound down, how this would happen, and how any ongoing assets could be archived and preserved when passed to a successor organisation. Any such organisation would need to honour this same set of principles</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref has two relationships that require us to set out plans for an orderly wind-down.</p>\n<p>The first is a condition of our incorporation as a non-profit in the state of New York. This explicitly includes a provision that requires us to hand over our operations and responsibilities to a successor non profit organisation that has a similar constituency and mission. The NY State Attorney General reviews and approves any major changes to ensure this requirement is met.</p>\n<p>The second is a condition of our being members of the DOI Foundation, which includes provisions for us to hand over management of DOIs to another registration agency should Crossref ever wind-down. It is worth noting that we have already seen this clause invoked for other registration agencies that have wound down and who have, as part of the DOI Foundation provisions, handed responsibility for their DOIs to Crossref.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that we are perfect on this score. We do not, for example, have any single place that outlines the steps that would need to be taken in order to execute the requirements laid out by our obligations to the state of New York and the IDF.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-formal-incentives-to-fulfil-mission--wind-down\">🟢 Formal incentives to fulfil mission &amp; wind-down</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>infrastructures exist for a specific purpose and that purpose can be radically simplified or even rendered unnecessary by technological or social change. If it is possible the organisation (and staff) should have direct incentives to deliver on the mission and wind down.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref has a track record of periodically reviewing our services and decommissioning those that are no longer needed - either because they have fulfilled their specific mission or because there is simply waning interest in them (arguably, the same thing).</p>\n<p>Again, this is not to say we are perfect on this score. We also have, by our last count, about 30 specialised, overlapping APIs- many of which are used by just a handful of users. These have escaped our normal scrutiny because they never had the status of a formal service and had not been through our product management process.</p>\n<p>But still, Crossref has long made it a habit to question its own existence. At virtually every board annual strategy meeting we ask the question “will technology X make Crossref unnecessary?” We need to continue with the attitude that the best thing we could do for our members is to make ourselves unnecessary.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-stakeholder-governed\">🔴 Stakeholder Governed</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>a board-governed organisation drawn from the stakeholder community builds more confidence that the organisation will take decisions driven by community consensus and consideration of different interests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Overall, Crossref meets most of the Governance requirements with the notable exception of broader stakeholder involvement.</p>\n<p>Of course, the key to this is how you define “stakeholder.”</p>\n<p>Some may dispute this and argue that Crossref “stakeholders” are “publishers” because they are the parties that invested in creating Crossref.</p>\n<p>But this narrow definition of “stakeholder” - focusing solely on those who have “invested”- is not widely held. In fact, common phrases like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.lexico.com/definition/stakeholder_economy\" target=\"_blank\">stakeholder economy</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/01/making-stakeholder-capitalism-a-reality\" target=\"_blank\">stakeholder capitalism</a>&rdquo; describe the exact opposite- systems that don&rsquo;t just focus on the “investor”, but which instead balance benefits to the investor with benefits to employees, the broader community, society, and the environment.</p>\n<p>It is this latter, broader definition of “stakeholder” that is used in POSI.</p>\n<p>And just in case anybody still thinks that people other than publishers don’t consider themselves “stakeholders’ in the Crossref infrastructure, we simply point to this, recently tweeted by <a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6507-6848\" target=\"_blank\">Brea Manuel</a>, a researcher, in celebration of their publication in Nature Reviews Chemistry (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41570-020-0214-z\" target=\"_blank\">read it, and learn how to recruit and retain a diverse workforce</a>):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/doi_tattoo.png\" alt=\"Brea Manuel&amp;rsquo;s DOI tattoo\" title=\"Brea Manuel's DOI tattoo\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"sustainability-1\">Sustainability</h3>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Financial sustainability is a key element of creating trust. “Trust” often elides multiple elements: intentions, resources, and checks and balances. An organisation that is both well meaning and has the right expertise will still not be trusted if it does not have sustainable resources to execute its mission. How do we ensure that an organisation has the resources to meet its obligations?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>In the area of sustainability, Crossref clearly meets four of the five of the criteria listed and is most of the way to meeting the fifth.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-time-limited-funds-are-used-only-for-time-limited-activities\">🟢 Time-limited funds are used only for time-limited activities</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>day to day operations should be supported by day to day sustainable revenue sources. Grant dependency for funding operations makes them fragile and more easily distracted from building core infrastructure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref has never supported production activities based on grants. Indeed Crossref’s delivery on this point is what inspired the approach taken in this principle. This distinguishes Crossref from many grant-funded infrastructure initiatives which either barely stay afloat or disappear altogether. Even those that survive often do so by pursuing solutions that align with their funder’s interest over their user’s needs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-goal-to-generate-surplus\">🟢 Goal to generate surplus</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>organisations which define sustainability based merely on recovering costs are brittle and stagnant. It is not enough to merely survive, it has to be able to adapt and change. To weather economic, social and technological volatility, they need financial resources beyond immediate operating costs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref has always attempted to generate a surplus. Crossref has generated surpluses since 2002 - so for 18 years of its 20 year existence.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-goal-to-create-contingency-fund-to-support-operations-for-12-months\">🟡 Goal to create contingency fund to support operations for 12 months</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>a high priority should be generating a contingency fund that can support a complete, orderly wind down (12 months in most cases). This fund should be separate from those allocated to covering operating risk and investment in development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref currently has a contingency fund that would support operations for 9 months. Although this may be standard for industry, it seems prudent to extend this in the case of infrastructure organisations, particularly when they are membership organisations. First, the very fact that something is infrastructure implies that the systemic effects of its failing ungracefully could have industry-wide repercussions. Second, the decision-making process of a membership organisation whose governance is voluntary is inherently slower. It has taken Crossref Board 9 months, for example, just to discuss the ramifications of adopting POSI.</p>\n<p>Given our recent financial performance, we expect Crossref could comfortably increase the contingency fund to support 12 months of operations within the next 2-3 years.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-mission-consistent-revenue-generation\">🟢 Mission-consistent revenue generation</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>potential revenue sources should be considered for consistency with the organisational mission and not run counter to the aims of the organisation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref has a good track record of periodically reviewing our services and fees and adjusting them to better support Crossref’s mission. The role of the Membership &amp; Fees Committee in advising the Board has been critical. The very first example of this was in the early days of Crossref when we dropped matching fees because they were disincentivising members from linking their references. Crossref was also quick to recognise that, in order to support global research and reach smaller publishers in lower income countries, we had to develop a sponsoring mechanism to help defray the costs and ameliorate the technical complexity of participating in Crossref. Most recently we have taken the decision to drop fees for Crossmark as it was clear they had become a barrier to our members distributing retraction and correction notifications in a machine actionable format.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-revenue-based-on-services-not-data\">🟢 Revenue based on services, not data</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>data related to the running of the research enterprise should be a community property. Appropriate revenue sources might include value-added services, consulting, API Service Level Agreements or membership fees</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref does not charge for or resell its members’ data. Doing so would restrict dissemination and reduce the discoverability of our members’ content. Instead our revenue comes from a combination of membership fees and service fees. The DOI registration is a member service that generates the bulk of our revenue. But our SLA-backed APIs are becoming increasingly popular as members and others seek to integrate Crossref metadata into their production workflows and services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"insurance-1\">Insurance</h3>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even with the best possible governance structures, critical infrastructure can still be co opted by a subset of stakeholders or simply drift away from the needs of the community. Long term trust requires the community to believe it retains control. Here we can learn from Open Source practices. To ensure that the community can take control if necessary, the infrastructure must be “forkable.” The community could replicate the entire system if the organisation loses the support of stakeholders, despite all established checks and balances. Each crucial part then must be legally and technically capable of replication, including software systems and data. Forking carries a high cost, and in practice this would always remain challenging. But the ability of the community to recreate the infrastructure will create confidence in the system. The possibility of forking prompts all players to work well together, spurring a virtuous cycle. Acts that reduce the feasibility of forking then are strong signals that concerns should be raised. The following principles should ensure that, as a whole, the organisation in extremis is forkable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref clearly meets two of the four Insurance requirements. And the remaining two can be met easily with some clarification and time.</p>\n<p>The “governance” section of POSI is designed to ensure that an infrastructure organisation is beholden to the broader stakeholder community and that it can not be co-opted by a particular party or special interest. And the “sustainability” section of POSI is designed to ensure that the infrastructure organisation takes the financial steps to ensure it can weather sudden changes in the financial or technical environment. But the last section, “insurance” is designed to protect stakeholder interests in case either “governance” or “sustainability” fail.</p>\n<p>The term “forkable” comes from the Open Source software community where it is used to indicate when a software community’s interests diverge and they decide to split a project into several projects, with each new project focusing on a particular sub-community&rsquo;s interests.</p>\n<p>One of the immediate worries that people have when they first hear of the concept of “forkability” is that it will encourage the creation many variations of a project based on frivolous criteria. But this simply does not happen. Forking a project is never easy and takes a lot of effort. It is only done successfully when a critical mass of the community becomes unhappy with the direction a project is taking and is willing to take on the substantial burden of running an entirely separate project. Without such a critical mass, the fork just withers and has virtually no effect on the original project.</p>\n<p>And the reason for this is simple, the mere knowledge that a project is “forkable” forces project maintainers to balance the interests of the community so that no sizable subgroup grows dissatisfied enough to fork the project.</p>\n<p>Forkability encourages reponsivness to the community by making sure that the community is not “locked-in.”</p>\n<p>Crossref itself was founded, in part, to prevent lock-in. Use of the DOI in linking citations makes it easier for publishers to move platforms, and for journals and societies to move between publishers.</p>\n<p>And Crossref itself is architected <em>in part</em> to ensure that lock-in is not possible. Crossref is just one of several DOI registration agencies. Members unhappy with Crossref, can move to another DOI registration agency and their citation links will continue to work. But there are things we could do to make this even easier.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-available-data-within-constraints-of-privacy-laws\">🟢 Available data (within constraints of privacy laws)</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is not enough that the data be made “open” if there is not a practical way to actually obtain it. Underlying data should be made easily available via periodic data dumps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref provides public APIs that allow users to access Crossref metadata. We are planning to eventually release yearly public data files. We already did this once <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/free-public-data-file-of-112-million-crossref-records/\">when we released a public data file in support of COVID-19 research.</a> This in no way prevents the provision of data through paid Service Level Agreement tiers that provide guarantees of regularity, availability or reliability for those that need it. Existing Metadata Plus customers primarily use data that is available through the open API or existing dumps, but value additional services that support their use-cases.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-patent-non-assertion\">🟡 Patent non-assertion</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The organisation should commit to a patent non-assertion covenant. The organisation may obtain patents to protect its own operations, but not use them to prevent the community from replicating the infrastructure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Crossref has never registered a patent. But the DOI Foundation, with significant support from Crossref, had to respond to (and then monitored) a set of patent applications that, if successful, the DOI System would infringe on. The applications were filed more than 15 years ago and haven’t been successful so these applications aren’t a current concern. As a result of this, the DOI Foundation adopted a patent policy in 2005 that covers all Registration Agencies and protects the DOI System. We may want to register protective patents in the future in order to enable us to defend ourselves against patent trolls.</p>\n<p>The problem with patents is that they could be used by an organisation to prevent the infrastructure forking. One technique that has been used by major companies to assure communities that they will not be affected by patents, is to make a <a href=\"http://www.iphandbook.org/handbook/ch07/p06/\" target=\"_blank\">patent non-assertion covenant</a>. For example, <a href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/21846.wss\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/dev_center/ms-devcentlp/1c24c7c8-28b0-4ce1-a47d-95fe1ff504bc\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> have made non-assertion statements in order to assure the open source and standards communities that they participate in that they will not co-opt an open source project or open standard by asserting patents on code or processes they contribute.</p>\n<p>Though Crossref has never registered a patent, issuing a patent non-assertion covenant would help assure stakeholders that we would not use patents in the future to prevent the community from forking the system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-open-source\">🟡 Open source</h4>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>All software required to run the infrastructure should be available under an open source license. This does not include other software that may be involved with running the organisation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>All code for new initiatives since 2007 has been released under an open source MIT license. The legacy Content System code could be open sourced within 12-18 months with no extra effort.</p>\n<p>If some Crossref stakeholders wanted to “fork” Crossref or leave for another DOI registration agency, their biggest hurdle would be trying to recreate the twenty years worth of rules and algorithms we use for processing and matching metadata. Without access to the source code of the system, it would be almost impossible for these to be reverse engineered.</p>\n<p>Similarly, without access to the source code of our system - it is difficult to ensure that Crossref is, indeed, non-discriminatory in the way it works with member content. It would be possible, for example, for Crossref to modify its matching algorithms to deliberately favour or deprecate some members’ content.</p>\n<p>If we want to assure the community that we are managing our member metadata fairly and if we want to provide even better insurance to our members and the broader stakeholders, we should make all of our code open source.</p>\n<p>The legacy so-called “CS” (content system) is in the process of being refactored. The only reason we cannot open source this immediately is that we still need to make some security changes to it. These security changes are being done as part of a current refactoring project and should be completed without any extra effort within 12-18 months. After that, we can open source the code.</p>\n<p>🟡 Open data (within constraints of privacy laws)</p>\n<div class=\"quotecite\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>For an infrastructure to be forked it will be necessary to replicate all relevant data. The CC0 waiver is best practice in making data legally available. Privacy and data protection laws will limit the extent to which this is possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>&ndash; POSI</cite></p>\n</div>\n<p>Achieving this simply requires us clarifying copyright and license information and that this will not have any effect on the metadata registered in Crossref by our members.</p>\n<p>First we should outline the current copyright status of a Crossref metadata record.</p>\n<p>The fundamental issue is that what we colloquially call “Crossref metadata” is actually a mix of elements, some of which come from our members, and some of which come from third parties and some of which comes from Crossref itself. These elements, in turn, each have different copyright implications.</p>\n<p>On top of this, Crossref has terms and conditions for its members and terms and conditions for specific services. These grant Crossref the right to do things with some classes of metadata and not do things with other classes of metadata - regardless of copyright.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the easiest case. Crossref already has two services with CC0 metadata:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Open Funder Registry</li>\n<li>Event Data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously, the POSI open data provision would not change anything for either service.</p>\n<p>The next easiest case is private data. Crossref collects PII (usernames, passwords IP addresses, etc.). This would remain private. And we will continue to manage it in conformance with GDPR. It would not be affected by the open data provision of POSI.</p>\n<p>Next let’s look at what most people probably think of as “Crossref metadata”- that is, the basic bibliographic metadata that Crossref has collected from its members since its founding (titles, authors, volumes, issues, etc). For the record- this does <em>not</em> include abstracts.</p>\n<p>Since 2000 Crossref has stated that it considers this basic bibliographic metadata to be “facts.” And under US law (Crossref is registered in the US) these facts are not subject to copyright at all. If this data is not subject to copyright at all, there is no way Crossref can “waive the copyright” under CC0. This metadata would not be affected at all under the open data provision of POSI.</p>\n<p>More recently, some of our members have been submitting abstracts to Crossref. These are copyrighted. In the case of subscription publishers, the copyright usually belongs to the publisher. In the case of open access publishers, the copyright most often belongs to the authors. In both cases, Crossref cannot waive copyright under CC0 because the copyright is not ours to waive. However, we are allowed to redistribute the abstracts with our metadata because that is part of the terms and conditions we have with our members. We already have <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/#00360\">language that notes the distinct copyright status of the abstracts in our metadata</a>, but, ideally, we should extend our schema to make that information available in a machine actionable form as well. In short, the copyright status of abstracts would not be affected at all by the open data provision of POSI.</p>\n<p>Crossref also has its <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/descriptive-metadata/references/#00564\">Reference Distribution Policy</a> that the board adopted in 2017 - limited and closed references are not distributed by Crossref and this won’t change.\n<em>[EDIT 6th June 2022 - all references are now open by default with the March 2022 board vote to remove any restrictions on reference distribution].</em></p>\n<p>And this leaves us with the one thing that <em>would</em> be affected by the open data provision of POSI- data that is created by Crossref itself as a byproduct of our services. By law, this data is under Crossref’s copyright unless we explicitly waive it. This data includes things like, participation reports, conflict reports, member IDs and Cited-by counts (just the counts, not the references) and any aggregations of our otherwise uncopyrighted data that might, by aggregating it, be subject to <em>sui generis</em> database rights. At the moment, although we distribute this data freely and without restriction, we have no explicit copyright attached to it. All we would be seeking to do is explicitly say that data generated by Crossref will be distributed CC0. Again, at first it would be enough to just specify this in human readable form, along with our other copyright information. But, eventually, we would want to include this information in machine actionable form in the metadata itself.</p>\n<p><strong>To summarise:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Metadata type</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Example</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Current Copyright</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Change under POSI</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Already CC0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Open Funder Registry, Event Data</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">CC0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Private</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Log files, user IDs</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Private</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Bibliographic</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Title, authors, volume, issue</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Facts</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Closed references</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Facts - but no distribution under the reference distribution board policy from 2017</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Limited references</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Facts - but no public distribution under the reference distribution board policy from 2017</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Open references</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Facts</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Crossref-generated data</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Participation data, reports, extracts</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Copyright Crossref</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">CC0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>[EDIT 6th June 2022 - all references are now open by default with the March 2022 board vote to remove any restrictions on reference distribution].</em></p>\n<br>\n<p>No member metadata will be affected by our adopting the open data provision of POSI. The only data that would be affected is data generated by Crossref itself.</p>\n<p>However, the adoption of this principle would likely have an effect on our decisions about future services. For example, under this principle we would not launch any new services where the data was not freely reusable or the copyright of the data was not CC0.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-and-next-steps\">Conclusion and Next steps</h2>\n<p>So again we face the paradox- We are announcing something that is simultaneously insignificant and important. It is insignificant in that we are simply saying that we will continue to do what we have largely been doing since Crossref was founded. But it is important because, in codifying what we have been doing, we are also confirming that these principles actually worked. That they were essential to building the trust that allowed us to function over the past twenty years, and they will continue to be essential in the future- as we look to work with existing organisations to strengthen current infrastructures, and work with new stakeholders to develop new infrastructures.</p>\n<p>So much of the work in building scholarly infrastructure is about building trust. We would love to see other organisations and services adopt POSI as well. Doing so would help us to collaborate more efficiently by allowing us to confirm from the outset that our fundamental values align. And having a set of verifiable commitments that we can point to will also help build the community&rsquo;s trust in our respective organisations and services.</p>\n<p>And this brings us to an important point. Although POSI might have been inspired by Crossref, POSI is not a “Crossref thang” and it never has been. The movement to create open scholarly infrastructures and to define and clarify the ground rules within which they operate has become a much broader community concern.</p>\n<p>To this end, we’ve worked with some sibling infrastructure organisations—such as Dryad and ROR—as well as the original authors of POSI to create a website where we could host the list of principles independent of the original blog post and independent of any single organisation:</p>\n<div class=\"shortcode-divwrap darkgrey-highlight\">\n<span><a href=\"http://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/\" target=\"_blank\">openscholarlyinfrastructure.org</a></span>\n</div>\n<br>\nMinimally, this provides a place for anybody who wants to link to or cite POSI - either because they are endorsing them, or because they are simply discussing them.\n<p>If we see enough activity of this type, then the site could evolve to become a register of those organisations and services who have formally adopted POSI and a place where they can link to their self-assessments against the principles.</p>\n<p>The community promoting, discussing and applying POSI has long since grown beyond the original authors of the POSI blog post. And it is also much larger than any single organisation. Our hope is that this website encourages that growth.</p>\n<p>And, of course, in addition to the external outreach and coordination, Crossref still has internal work to do in addressing the outstanding issues that were raised in our own self-assessment above. We need to increase our contingency funds. We need to publish a patent non-assertion covenant. We need to open source our core software. And we need to clarify our metadata license information and make it explicit that Crossref waives copyright (using CC-0) for any metadata generated by Crossref. And, finally, as Crossref expands and starts working with different stakeholders, we will need to adjust our governance and the composition of our board accordingly. We will, of course, post updates here as we make progress on addressing these areas.</p>\n<p>2020 marked Crossref’s 20th birthday. What a grim year to have an anniversary. But we are, at least, ending it on a little bit of a high. We are delighted that the issue of open scholarly infrastructure has become so prominent in the community. And we are eager to help strengthen and extend this infrastructure. The decision by Crossref’s board to adopt POSI is the equivalent of Crossref finally adopting a written constitution. And it is a fitting launch to our next twenty years.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Calling all 24-hour (PID) party people!","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/calling-all-24-hour-pid-party-people/","published":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"While we wish we could be together in person to celebrate the fifth PIDapalooza, there&rsquo;s an upside to moving it online: now everyone can participate in the universe&rsquo;s best PID party!

EASE President Duncan Nicholas accurately introduces it as a whole lot of information and insights about metadata and communication standards into one post&hellip;</p>\n<p>I was given a wide brief to decide on the topic of my EASE blog, so I thought I&rsquo;d write one that tries to encompass <em>everything</em> - I&rsquo;ll explain what I mean by that.</p>\n<p>In the past, Crossref has had the opportunity to talk to EASE members about the importance of registering content whose metadata contains important information related to the article. Richer metadata helps to connect the content to other key information such as who wrote it, who it was funded by, the relevant license, the research it cites, any updates to the work such as corrections and retractions, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.20316/ESE.2019.45.19010\" target=\"_blank\">the data that underpin the research</a>. The use of open persistent identifiers like DOIs, funder IDs, ORCID iDs and ROR IDs are always recommended.</p>\n<p>Such rich and connected metadata also helps discoverability of the published research in a different way than just direct access; if you can find something based on looking at the publications related to a particular funder, author, or institution, then there are more ways to come across what you&rsquo;re looking for. Making links between objects underpinning the research also helps put the research in context and can help further research by making connections to other valuable information that may have been more difficult to make otherwise.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned the Research Nexus in the title of this post. It&rsquo;s achieved by declaring relationships between publications and other associated research objects, and from those objects to related publications. The metadata that reveals relationships between research objects can be as informative as the objects themselves. These relationships can assert certain facts that may not be otherwise obvious: this is our goal with the Research Nexus. These relationships and assertions need to exist not just on the web pages of the outputs, but also reflected in a standard way in the metadata so that the information is computer-readable and can be used at scale. As Jennifer Lin, who coined the term, explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Researchers are adopting new tools that create consistency and shareability in their experimental methods. Increasingly, these are viewed as key components in driving reproducibility and replicability. They provide transparency in reporting key methodological and analytical information. They are also used for sharing the artefacts which make up a processing trail for the results: data, material, analytical code, and related software on which the conclusions of the paper rely.

The initiative calls on scholarly publishers to make the abstracts of their publications openly available. More specifically, publishers that work with Crossref to register DOIs for their publications are requested to include abstracts in the metadata they deposit in Crossref. These abstracts will then be made openly available by Crossref. 39 publishers have already agreed to join I4OA and to open their abstracts.</p>\n<p>Where are we at the moment in terms of openness of abstracts? For an individual publisher working with Crossref, the percentage of the publisher’s content for which an abstract is available in Crossref can be found in Crossref’s <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep\" target=\"_blank\">Participation Reports</a>. The chart presented below gives the overall picture (as of September 1, 2020) for medium-sized and large publishers working with Crossref. The vertical axis shows the number of journal articles of a publisher in the period 2018-2020. Because of the large differences between publishers in the number of articles they publish, this axis has a logarithmic scale. The horizontal axis shows the percentage of the articles of a publisher for which an abstract is available in Crossref. The orange dots represent publishers that have agreed to join I4OA. The publishers colored in blue have not yet agreed to join the initiative.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/i4oa-chart.png\"\nalt=\"Publishers with abstracts in Crossref\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>A similar chart was published a few months ago in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@aarontay/why-openly-available-abstracts-are-important-overview-of-the-current-state-of-affairs-bb7bde1ed751\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post on the importance of open abstracts</a>. Comparing the above chart with the one published a few months ago, the first effects of I4OA are already visible. While for most publishers the percentage of abstracts available in Crossref has hardly changed, it has increased from 11% to 95% for the Royal Society, one of the founding publishers of I4OA. This reflects the efforts the Royal Society has made over the past months to improve the availability of abstracts in Crossref for its content, not only for new content but also for existing content. For SAGE, another founding publisher of I4OA, the percentage of abstracts available in Crossref has increased from 38% to 50%. A further increase can be expected to take place in the coming months. The third founding publisher of I4OA, Hindawi, has remained at a stable level, with abstracts being available for 97% of its content.</p>\n<p>The above chart shows that many publishers supporting I4OA are already making abstracts available in Crossref. Other publishers do not yet make abstracts available in Crossref but have nevertheless decided to join I4OA. This is the case for Frontiers, PLOS, and Karger, and also for several smaller publishers not visible in the above chart, such as EMBO and Ubiquity Press. These publishers are currently adjusting their workflows and will start submitting abstracts to Crossref soon.</p>\n<p>Of the publishers that have not yet joined I4OA, some may not yet be aware of I4OA, while others may need more time to decide whether they will join the initiative. As can be seen in the above chart, most publishers that have not yet joined I4OA do not make abstracts available in Crossref at the moment. However, some publishers have not yet joined I4OA even though they do make abstracts available in Crossref. We hope these publishers will join I4OA soon. By joining the initiative, these publishers would formalize their commitment to openness of abstracts.</p>\n<p>None of the publishers in the above chart makes abstracts available in Crossref for 100% of its journal content. Some publishers, such as Copernicus and Hindawi, are close to 100%, but even these publishers have some content for which no abstract is available. Importantly, this does not necessarily mean that publishers have failed to submit abstracts to Crossref for some of their content. Instead, it may simply mean that some of their journal content does not have an abstract. Research articles usually have an abstract, but many other types of content published in journals, such as book reviews, letters, editorials, and corrections, often do not have an abstract. For most publishers, it is therefore impossible to make abstracts available for 100% of their content. Moreover, since Crossref does not distinguish between different types of content published in journals, we cannot provide separate statistics on the availability of abstracts for different types of journal content.</p>\n<p>As an example, let’s consider Brill, a publisher that has joined I4OA and that mainly focuses on the humanities and social sciences. Abstracts are available in Crossref for 57% of Brill’s content in the period 2018-2020. This may suggest that Brill has failed to submit abstracts to Crossref for a significant share of its content. However, when we look up journal publications of Brill in 2018 and 2019 in the Web of Science database, abstracts turn out to be available for only 68% of these publications. Assuming that Web of Science has more or less complete coverage of abstracts, this seems to indicate that Brill has already submitted most of its abstracts to Crossref. In fact, Web of Science shows that about a quarter of the publications of Brill are book reviews and that hardly any of these book reviews has an abstract. This illustrates why some publishers, for instance those that publish many book reviews, cannot be expected to get close to 100% availability of abstracts.</p>\n<p>Despite the above caveats, it is clear that there is still a long way to go in improving the availability of abstracts in Crossref. As of September 1, 2020, abstracts were available for 21% of all journal articles in Crossref in the period 2018-2020. In Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index), 86% of all journal publications in 2018 and 2019 that have a DOI also have an abstract.</p>\n<p>Publishers who wish to distribute their abstracts openly through Crossref can include them in the normal content registration process. They can send XML to Crossref (using Crossref’s metadata deposit schema), either directly via HTTPS POST or via the Crossref admin system. For back-content, a resubmission of the full XML is required. In addition, various tools can be used to deposit abstracts. Open Journal Systems (OJS) has a plugin that supports the depositing of abstracts. Metadata Manager also facilitates this, but only for journal articles. Crossref’s web deposit form does not yet support abstracts, but Crossref is working on this.</p>\n<p>To keep track of the progress publishers are making in depositing abstracts in Crossref, we plan to publish regular updates of the chart presented above on the I4OA website. We look forward to witnessing the impact of I4OA in the coming months!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Thank you to guest authors Bianca Kramer and Ludo Waltman, as well as the other founding members of I4OA.</em></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Get involved with Peer Review Week 2020 and register your peer reviews with Crossref","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/get-involved-with-peer-review-week-2020-and-register-your-peer-reviews-with-crossref/","published":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Just when you thought 2020 couldn’t go any faster, it’s Peer Review week again!

This includes ensuring that the peer review process is transparent (easily discoverable, accessible, and understandable by anyone writing, reviewing, or reading peer-reviewed content) and that everyone involved in the process receives the training and education needed to play their part in making it reliable and trustworthy.”</p>\n<p>A key way that publishers can make peer reviews easily discoverable and accessible is by registering them with Crossref - creating a persistent identifier for each review, linking them to the relevant article, and providing rich metadata to show what part this item played in the evolution of the content. It also gives a way to acknowledge the incredible work done by academics in this area. </p>\n<p>For Peer Review week last year,  Rosa and Rachael from Crossref created this short video to explain more.</p>\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A_wN3nqP07Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>Fast forward to 2020 and over 75k peer reviews have now been registered with us by a range of members including Wiley, Peer J, eLife, Stichting SciPost, Emerald, IOP Publishing, Publons, The Royal Society and Copernicus. We encourage all members to register peer reviews with us - and you can keep up to date with everyone who is using <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/types/peer-review/works?facet=publisher-name:*&amp;rows=0\" target=\"_blank\">this API query</a>.

Linked data and protocols are key for reproducibility, peer reviews increase trust and show the evolution of knowledge, and other research objects help increase the discoverability of content. Registering these objects and stating the relationships between them support the research nexus.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Article_Nexus_Reproducibility.png\" width=\"60%\" alt=\"The Research Nexus\" >\n</div>\n<p>Peer reviews in particular are key to demonstrating that the scholarly record is not fixed - it’s a living entity that moves and changes over time. Registering peer reviews formally integrates these objects into the scholarly record and makes sure the links between the reviews and the article both exist and persist over time.   It allows analysis or research on peer reviews and highlights richer discussions than those provided by the article alone, showing how discussion and conversation help to evolve knowledge. In particular, post-publication reviews highlight how the article is no longer the endpoint - after publication, research is further validated (or not!) and new ideas emerge and build on each other.  You can see a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/peer-review-publications/\">real-life example</a> of this from F1000 in a blog post written by Jennifer Lin a few years ago.</p>\n<p>As we’ve said before:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Article metadata + peer review metadata = a fuller picture of the evolution of knowledge </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Registering peer reviews also provides publishing transparency and reviewer accountability, and enables contributors to get credit for their work.  If peer review metadata includes ORCID IDs, our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/orcid/\">ORCID auto-update service</a> means that we can automatically update the author’s ORCID record (with their permission), while our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/youve-had-your-say-now-what-next-steps-for-schema-changes/\">forthcoming schema update</a> will take this even further, making CRediT roles available in our schema.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-register-peer-reviews-with-crossref\">How to register peer reviews with Crossref</h3>\n<p>You need to be a member of Crossref in order to register your peer reviews with us and you can currently register peer reviews by sending us your XML files. Unfortunately, you can’t currently register peer reviews using our helper tools like the OJS plugin, Metadata Manager, or the web deposit form. </p>\n<p>You can find out more about <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/content-types-intro/peer-reviews/\">registering peer reviews</a> on our website - we even have a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/schema-library/markup-guide/peer-reviews/\">range of markup examples</a>. </p>\n<p>We know that there’s a range of outputs from the peer review process, and our schema allows you to identify many of them, including referee reports, decision letters, and author responses.

Funders need to be able to discover and track the research and researchers they have supported. Academic librarians need to easily find all of the publications associated with their campus. Journals need to know where authors are affiliated so they can determine eligibility for institutionally sponsored publishing agreements.</p>\n<p>Until recently, an open, unambiguous, and persistent identifier for research organization affiliations has been a missing layer of the scholarly ecosystem. DOIs could identify articles and datasets and other research outputs, and ORCID IDs could identify researchers, but no equivalent solution was available to identify institutions. With the launch of the <a href=\"https://ror.org\" target=\"_blank\">Research Organization Registry (ROR)</a> in 2019 (which Crossref has <a href=\"https://ror.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">helped to develop</a>), the landscape is changing. ROR IDs are an opportunity to make affiliation details easier for publishers to use and easier for those who rely on this data.</p>\n<p>Affiliations are a key piece of Crossref metadata that has been missing, but will soon be <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/youve-had-your-say-now-what-next-steps-for-schema-changes/\">supported in the Crossref metadata schema</a>. This means that content registered with Crossref can be associated with a ROR IDs to  enable better tracking and discovery of research and other publication outputs by institution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-ror\">What is ROR?</h2>\n<p>ROR is the Research Organization Registry––<strong>open, noncommercial, community-led infrastructure</strong> for research organization identifiers. The registry currently includes globally unique persistent identifiers and associated metadata for more than <a href=\"https://ror.org/search\" target=\"_blank\">98,000 research organizations</a> (as of August 2020).</p>\n<p>ROR IDs are specifically designed to be <strong>implemented in any system</strong> that captures institutional affiliations and to enable connections (via persistent identifiers and networked research infrastructure) between research organizations, research outputs, and researchers.</p>\n<p>ROR IDs are <strong>interoperable with those in other identifier registries</strong>, including GRID (which provided the seed data that ROR launched with), Crossref Funder Registry, ISNI, and Wikidata. ROR data is available under a CC0 waiver and can be accessed via a public <a href=\"https://api.ror.org/organizations\" target=\"_blank\">API</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4596503\" target=\"_blank\">data dump</a>.</p>\n<p>ROR is not the first organization identifier to exist. But ROR is distinct because it is <strong>completely <a href=\"https://github.com/ror-community\" target=\"_blank\">open</a>, specifically focused on <a href=\"https://ror.org/scope\" target=\"_blank\">identifying affiliations</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=\"https://ror.org/supporters\" target=\"_blank\">collaboratively developed by, with, and for key stakeholders</a></strong> in scholarly communications. ROR is operated as a joint initiative by Crossref, <a href=\"https://datacite.org\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite</a>, and <a href=\"https://cdlib.org\" target=\"_blank\">California Digital Library</a>, and was launched with seed data from GRID in collaboration with Digital Science. These organizations have invested resources into building an open registry of research organization identifiers that can be embedded in scholarly infrastructure to effectively link research to organizations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-care-about-ror-ids-in-crossref-metadata\">Why care about ROR IDs in Crossref metadata?</h2>\n<p>Ed Pentz, Crossref’s Executive Director, explains the key role ROR can play in enriching Crossref metadata:</p>\n<p><em>“Over the years Crossref has expanded the metadata it collects (for example, ORCID IDs and license URLs) based on the changing needs of our members and the scholarly research community. A key type of metadata that is missing from Crossref is affiliations. We’ve had a lot of feedback from members that adding affiliations should be a priority. At <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual/\">Crossref LIVE19 in Amsterdam</a>, ROR was ranked joint first place for Crossref by the 100 plus attendees at the meeting. For the last few years we’ve been diligently working on the initiative and are very happy that ROR is now coming to fruition.”</em></p>\n<p>Crossref metadata does include some affiliations already. But this data is not comprehensive or consistent, and appears as free-text strings only (even if originally sourced from a list of institutions). A search for UC Berkeley, for instance, returns multiple variants of the university’s name:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>University of California, Berkeley</li>\n<li>University of California-Berkeley</li>\n<li>University of California Berkeley</li>\n<li>UC Berkeley</li>\n<li>And likely more&hellip;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it isn&rsquo;t too difficult for a human to guess that &ldquo;UC Berkeley,&rdquo; &ldquo;University of California, Berkeley,&rdquo; and &ldquo;University of California at Berkeley&rdquo; are all referring to the same university, a machine interpreting this information wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily make the same connections. If you are trying to easily find all of the publications associated with UC Berkeley, you would need to run and reconcile multiple searches at best, or miss data completely at worst. This is where an affiliation identifier comes in: a single, unambiguous, standardized identifier that will always stay the same (for UC Berkeley, that would be <a href=\"https://ror.org/01an7q238\" target=\"_blank\">https://ror.org/01an7q238</a>).</p>\n<p>ROR IDs for affiliations can transform the usability of Crossref metadata. While it&rsquo;s crucial to have IDs for affiliations, it&rsquo;s equally important that the affiliation data can be easily used. The ROR dataset is CC0, so ROR IDs and associated affiliation data can be freely and openly used and reused without any restrictions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-publishers\">What does this mean for publishers?</h2>\n<p>As the Crossref schema update is being cleared for takeoff, this is a good time for publishers and publishing service providers to be thinking about adopting ROR.</p>\n<p>ROR IDs can be useful in publishing workflows in a variety of ways. They can easily be implemented into manuscript tracking systems to identify the affiliations of submitting authors and co-authors. This can be done via a simple institution lookup that connects to the ROR API. Authors choose their affiliation from a dropdown list populated from ROR; they do not have to provide a ROR ID or even know that a ROR ID is being collected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gyazo.com/65ef42890287ae978f61add5d36b1d31\"><img src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/65ef42890287ae978f61add5d36b1d31.gif\" alt=\"Image from Gyazo\" width=\"780\"/></a></p>\n<p>Upon publication, ROR affiliation data can be included when content is registered with Crossref. ROR IDs are also supported in the JATS XML format that many publishers use. Crossref metadata can be searched and crawled, and the Crossref API will make ROR IDs available so affiliation data can be captured by tools and services and fed into downstream reporting and tracking systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-ready-to-ror\">Get ready to ROR!</h2>\n<p>ROR is already working with a number of publishers and service providers that are planning to integrate ROR in their systems, map their affiliation data to ROR IDs, and/or include ROR IDs in publication metadata.</p>\n<p>For example: <a href=\"https://rupress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rockefeller University Press</a> has already added the collection of ROR IDs to their publication workflow. Upon submission, the author selects an institutional affiliation from a dropdown list of options that comes from ROR. Rockefeller University Press also relies on this affiliation data for billing and licensing purposes to coordinate Gold Open Access publishing agreements.</p>\n<p>In addition to publishers, libraries and repositories and other stakeholders are building in support for ROR. You can also see the list of active and in-progress ROR integrations <a href=\"https://ror.org/integrations\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We know decisions about identifier adoption aren&rsquo;t easy or immediate, so <a href=\"mailto:info@ror.org\">get in touch with ROR</a> if you have questions or want to be more involved in the project. ROR holds regular community meetings and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W61JMsC3Dho\" target=\"_blank\">webinars</a> and supports several community working groups for those interested in implementing ROR IDs and working with ROR data. This is a community-driven effort so we want to hear from you!</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Evolving our support for text-and-data mining","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/evolving-our-support-for-text-and-data-mining/","published":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Many researchers want to carry out analysis and extraction of information from large sets of data, such as journal articles and other scholarly content.

Methods such as screen-scraping are error-prone, place too much strain on content sites and may be unrepeatable or break if site layouts change. Providing researchers with automated access to the full-text content via DOIs and Crossref metadata reduces these problems, allowing for easy deduplication and reproducibility. <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/text-and-data-mining/\">Supporting text and data mining</a> echoes our mission to make research outputs easy to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse.</p>\n<p>In 2013 Crossref embarked on a project to better support Crossref members and researchers with Text and Data Mining requests and access. There were two main parts to the project:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>To collect and make available full-text links and publisher TDM license links in the metadata.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide a service (TDM click-through service) for Crossref members to post their additional TDM terms and conditions and for researchers to access, review and accept these terms.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/news/2014-05-29-crossref-text-and-data-mining-services-simplify-researcher-access\">The TDM click-through was launched in May 2014</a>.</p>\n<p>To date, 37.5 million works registered with Crossref have both <a href=\"http://api.crossref.org/works?filter=has-license:true,has-full-text:true,license.version:tdm&amp;facet=publisher-name:*&amp;rows=0\" target=\"_blank\">full-text links and TDM license information</a>. We continue to encourage all members to include full-text links and license information in the metadata they register to assist researchers with TDM. You can see how each member is doing via its Participation Report (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/311\" target=\"_blank\">Wiley&rsquo;s</a>).</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/tdm_blog_prep.png\"\nalt=\"participation report screenshot for Wiley\" width=\"60%\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>Members are also making subscription content available for text mining (temporarily or otherwise) for specific purposes, such as to help the research community with its response to COVID-19. Back in April <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/helping-researchers-identify-content-they-can-text-mine/\">we highlighted how this can be achieved</a> by including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A &ldquo;free to read&rdquo; element in the access indicators section of publisher metadata indicating that the content is being made available free-of-charge (gratis)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An assertion element indicating that the content being made available is available free-of-charge.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To access Crossref&rsquo;s <strong>click-through</strong> tool for text and data mining, users could log in via their ORCID iD. They could then review TDM license agreements posted by Crossref members and accept, reject or postpone their decisions until later. Having agreed to a publisher&rsquo;s terms and conditions this action was logged against the user&rsquo;s API token which they could use when requesting full-text from the publisher.</p>\n<p>Since the pilot in 2014, only 2 publishers have continued with the tool and fewer than 300 API tokens have been issued.</p>\n<p>Publishers have since developed their own mechanisms for managing TDM requests. The introduction of UK (<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/375954/Research.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2014</a>) / EU (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.130.01.0092.01.ENG\" target=\"_blank\">2019</a>) copyright exceptions for TDM has significantly reduced the number of requests and at the same time, more and more content is published under an open access license.</p>\n<p>Given the low take-up of the click-through by both publishers and researchers, its goals are no longer being met. <strong>Therefore we will retire the TDM click-through in December 2020.</strong> Until that date, it will still operate for the two publishers and various researchers who use it while they finish implementing their alternative plans.</p>\n<p>Crossref will continue to collect member-supplied TDM licensing information in metadata for individual works, and researchers can continue to find this via the Crossref APIs.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Similarity Check news: introducing the next generation iThenticate.","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/similarity-check-news-introducing-the-next-generation-ithenticate./","published":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Crossref’s Similarity Check service is used by our members to detect text overlap with previously published work that may indicate plagiarism of scholarly or professional works.

This continues to be true, and the latest change is that I’m happy to say that I will be staying on as Executive Director of Crossref. At the recent Crossref board meeting, I rescinded my resignation and the board happily accepted this.</p>\n<p>What happened? Well, a lot has changed since <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/leaving-crossref\">I announced that I was leaving</a> back in February. The pandemic has upended “business as usual” and everyone is rethinking pretty much everything. It’s clear that as a result of the crisis, there will be greater economic pressure on our community. These are difficult times and they are going to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>The people at Crossref are amazing and I’ve been impressed and inspired by everyone’s resilience and creativity in responding to these unusual challenges. Crossref has a very special organizational culture and I want to remain a part of it and continue to develop it.</p>\n<p>I’ve also been inspired by the board. In particular, at its July meeting they passed a progressive motion based on a proposal from the leadership team:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>RESOLVED: Crossref should proactively lead an effort to explore, with other infrastructure organizations and initiatives, how we can improve the scholarly research ecosystem. Crossref is committed to the collaborative development of open scholarly infrastructure for the benefit of our members and the wider research community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the result of a process that started back in 2019. In the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-turning-point-is-a-time-for-reflection\">A turning point is a time for reflection</a> blog post, we took a step back as we approached Crossref’s 20th anniversary. We conducted research into <a href=\"http://bit.ly/crvalue\" target=\"_blank\">the perceived value of Crossref</a>, reflected on what we had achieved, and what the future holds for Crossref. At our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual\">annual meeting, &ldquo;the strategy one&rdquo;</a> and in our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/y8ygwm5\" target=\"_blank\">annual report fact file</a>, we reminded people of the organization’s original founding purpose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To promote the development and cooperative use of new and innovative technologies to speed and facilitate scientific and other scholarly research.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following on from 2019, as the pandemic hit, we held virtual strategic sessions with the board in March, May and June. These culminated in the motion above, which allows Crossref to fully embrace this simple, but ambitious, vision. This was a game changer for me, and I realized there was nothing else I wanted to do or that better suited my skills and experience than to continue to lead Crossref and work with the community through the next phase of transformation.</p>\n<p>This is not the time for “business as usual”. We live in an interconnected, interdependent world and open infrastructure organizations have to collaborate more deeply and look at doing things differently in order to improve the scholarly research ecosystem.

The pandemic has meant big adjustments in terms of working; challenges for parents balancing childcare and professional lives; anxieties and tensions we never had before; the strain of potentially being away from co-workers, friends, and family for a prolonged period of time. Many have suffered job losses and around the world, many have sadly lost their lives to the virus.</p>\n<p>I’ve been very fortunate that my family and friends remain in good health and very grateful to work for a supportive and caring organization such as Crossref. I don’t usually work from home every day, so adjusting to the ‘new normal’ these last few months has been difficult at times. I certainly miss seeing my colleagues in the Oxford office day-to-day, and now have a new appreciation for the challenges our remote working members of staff face, particularly when it comes to feeling quite isolated at times. I’ve also learnt about the importance of good communication and building in greater flexibility to projects, especially when you are not able to see people face-to-face.</p>\n<p>My role as Outreach Manager is all about people; it often involves organising and attending industry events as well as running our own educational days, which we call our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/events/\">Crossref LIVE events</a>. The global health crisis brought the majority of international travel to an abrupt halt, something the environment may thank us for, but that also requires a dramatic reimagining of how we can effectively and empathetically engage with our members and the wider community.</p>\n<p>As our planned in-person events have been postponed, for now, we converted our LIVE events into an online format, which we have so far run in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/McDIrEpWph4\" target=\"_blank\">Arabic</a>, <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/t/crossref-virtual-live-spanish/1324?u=vanessa\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish</a>, <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/t/crossref-live-korea/1351/2?u=vanessa\" target=\"_blank\">Korean</a> and <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/t/crossref-virtual-live-brazil/1323/2?u=vanessa\" target=\"_blank\">Brazilian Portuguese</a> with help from <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/our-ambassadors/\">our Ambassadors</a> and technical support team. We have had better attendance and engagement than we ever dreamed, with lots of thoughtful questions and positive feedback. While an online format has its limitations it also brings new opportunities, particularly by enabling us to reach many members who would not be able to attend a physical event. We have more in the works for the rest of the year, so keep a lookout on our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/webinars/\" target=\"_blank\">webinar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/events/\" target=\"_blank\">events</a> pages.</p>\n<p>We have all had to adapt to new ways of living and working this year, but vital research continues to be done and new content continues to be published. We embrace new ways of engaging with our international membership so we can continue to support them in their roles and in working with our systems, despite the uncertain circumstances we find ourselves in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons learned:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Online events need to be much shorter than physical ones. Zoom fatigue is real, no one can stay focused for long periods of time at the screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flexibility is key, running events in multiple languages and time-zones make them more accessible for a geographically diverse audience, but also ensuring recordings and other materials are readily available means people can engage with the content in their own time. And they do.

The committee will gather responses from those interested and create the slate of candidates that our membership will vote on in an election in September. Expressions of interest will be due Friday, June 19, 2020.</p>\n<p>The role of the board at Crossref is to provide strategic and financial oversight of the organization, as well as guidance to the Executive Director and the staff leadership team, with the key responsibilities being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Setting the strategic direction for the organization;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing financial oversight; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Approving new policies and services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The board is representative of our membership base and guides the staff leadership team on trends affecting scholarly communications. The board sets strategic directions for the organization while also providing oversight into policy changes and implementation. Board members have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure sound operations. Board members do this by attending board meetings, as well as joining more specific board committees.</p>\n<p>As an example, in 2019 the board decided to remove fees for the Crossmark service. This involved a strategic review of the service and its alignment with the mission by the Membership &amp; Fees committee; followed by a review of the financial implications of removing the fee; and ultimately, a vote by the full board to remove the fee starting in 2020.</p>\n<p>Crossref&rsquo;s services provide central infrastructure to scholarly communications. Crossref&rsquo;s board helps shape the future of our services, and by extension, impacts the broader scholarly ecosystem. We are looking for board members to contribute their experience and perspective. </p>\n<h2 id=\"im-interested-but-busy-what-is-expected-of-board-members\">I&rsquo;m interested but busy! What is expected of board members?</h2>\n<p>Board members attend three meetings each year that typically take place in March, July, and November. Meetings have taken place in a variety of international locations and travel support is provided when needed.</p>\n<p>Starting in 2020, following travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, the board introduced a plan to convene at least one of the board meetings virtually each year and all committee meetings take place virtually. Most board members sit on at least one Crossref committee. Care is taken to accommodate the wide range of timezones in which our board members live.</p>\n<p>While the expressions of interest are specific to an individual, the seat that is elected to the board belongs to the member organization. The primary board member also names an alternate who may attend meetings in the event that the primary board member is unable.</p>\n<p>Board members are expected to be comfortable assuming the responsibilities listed above and to prepare and participate in board meeting discussions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-the-election\">About the election</h2>\n<p>The board is elected through the &ldquo;one member, one vote&rdquo; policy wherein every member of Crossref has a single vote to elect representatives to the Crossref board. Board terms are for three years, and this year there are six seats open for election.</p>\n<p>The board maintains a balance of seats, with eight seats for smaller publishers and eight seats for larger publishers, in an effort to ensure that the diversity of experiences and perspectives of the publishing community is represented in decisions made at Crossref. This year we will elect two of the larger publisher seats and four of the smaller publisher seats.</p>\n<p>The election takes place online and voting will open in September. Election results will be shared at the November board meeting and new members will commence their term in 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-the-nominating-committee\">About the nominating committee</h2>\n<p>The nominating committee will review the expressions of interest and select a slate of candidates for election.

After all, they have behind them an extraordinary legacy of creating and distributing data about books: the metadata that supports discovery, sales and analysis.</p>\n<p>Librarianship, and the management of book catalogs at scale took off in the nineteenth century. The Dewey Decimal Classification, the various initiatives of the Library of Congress and the British Library followed. Innovations from the 1960s gave us MARC records and ISBNs. The late 90s produced ONIX, which gave the book industry a tremendous start in migrating online. </p>\n<p>However, progress in the decades after appears to have been less dramatic. Some might even argue that this tremendous legacy and wealth of metadata experience has acted as a weight, and has slowed progress. Nowhere is this lack of progress clearer than in the discovery and analysis of book chapters: approximately one-quarter of books published per year has chapter-level metadata, and about two-thirds of books don&rsquo;t have a persistent and open identifier, ratios that have not significantly changed over the last ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>Only one-quarter of scholarly books make chapter level metadata available</strong></p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/rubicon-blog-piechart.png\" alt=\"pie chart\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<p>The proportion of edited books and monographs with chapter-level data is approximately one-quarter of all books published in the last ten years. Calculating this figure is necessarily approximate, using numbers published in Grimme et al (2019), and based on data and observed trends in both Dimensions and Crossref.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-why-the-lack-of-progress\">So why the lack of progress? </h3>\n<p>For many publishers and their vendor partners, with systems geared up to the efficient delivery of title-level information, the case for moving towards chapter-level metadata can seem daunting (and potentially expensive!).</p>\n<p>Metadata is necessarily detailed and it&rsquo;s not the kind of thing most people will dabble in. Practitioners, as in other technical fields, have expertise that others may find difficult to leverage if they don&rsquo;t know what questions to ask. Organizations often find themselves entrenched in outdated approaches to metadata. </p>\n<p>Crossref and Metadata 2020 are collaborating to produce arguments why publishers should move from book-level metadata to chapters. They&rsquo;ve been working with representatives from the scholarly community, including both small and large presses, not-for-profits and university presses. </p>\n<h3 id=\"here-we-present-7-reasons-why-publishers-should-collect-chapter-level-metadata\">Here we present 7 reasons why publishers should collect chapter-level metadata:</h3>\n<p>1. <strong>Increased discoverability</strong><br>\nIncreasingly, we&rsquo;re seeing students and researchers move away from traditional book catalogs and onto more general purpose tools, that are often optimized for journal content, and which may - inadvertently - exclude books and chapters from search results. Making chapter level data and DOIs available places book content into these new channels at no additional cost, and starts to reduce the dependency on specialist vendors. Discovery is simplified, requiring less familiarity or expertise to find relevant book content. </p>\n<p>2. <strong>Increased usage</strong><br>\nExposing the contents of books at a more granular level drives more users towards the book content, and increasing usage numbers and (depending on platform and business model) revenue.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Matching author expectations</strong><br>\nNew generations of authors expect their content to be easily discoverable in the platforms they use. Without chapter level data, this content won&rsquo;t easily be found in Google Scholar, Mendeley or ResearchGate. For younger researchers, for those in certain disciplines or using resources well-suited to it, if the chapter metadata - which in many cases requires either an introductory paragraph or an abstract - is missing, the book may as well not exist.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Author exposure</strong><br>\nAbout half of scholarly book publishing is thought to be in the form of collected works: books where two or three editors get credit at the top level, but dozens of authors contribute to the chapters. Without chapter level metadata, these authors &ndash; the book authors of tomorrow &ndash; get no credit for their efforts.</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Usage and citations reporting</strong><br>\nHaving chapters readily available in the modern platforms means that they start to accumulate evidence of sharing and citations from the moment of being published. Where chapter content is available on its own, the lack of associated metadata inhibits this evidence. After all, the DOI is a citation identifier. Evidence of impact is now critical for research evaluation, funding, tenure and promotion, and without this data, an author&rsquo;s chapter may as well remain unread.</p>\n<p>6. <strong>Supporting your authors with funding compliance and reporting</strong><br>\nAuthors are increasingly being mandated by their funders to report back on the status of their books and chapters. And, in the case of Open Books and Open Chapters, the funders and authors are frequently the ultimate clients, who are looking to record and report evidence of both academic or social impact. Making chapter level information and identifiers available will facilitate this evidence gathering, especially for open chapters within otherwise non-open books, and increasingly common phenomena.</p>\n<p>7. <strong>Understanding the hot topics in your books</strong><br>\nWhether you use Altmetric, or one of the other data sources that capture book activity, being able to access the social and media metrics of the chapters in your book gives you an immediate insight into the topics that capture interest at a broader level. Vital information when it comes to planning more books in the space, especially if you&rsquo;re on the look out for books with trade crossover potential.</p>\n<p>With chapter-level data, publishers can summarize their programs and compare how many authors they work with, how many book titles they have and where there might be gaps in subject and authors omitted from the metadata. Does the scholarly record fully reflect each book? If not, there may be a good deal of information that is simply unavailable to the machines that read the metadata and use it in systems throughout scholarly communications. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s becoming easier to manage this data. Although traditional book metadata systems don&rsquo;t always support chapter-level data, they do often permit publishers to register title-level DOIs, and with Crossref encouraging ISBN information alongside the generation of chapter level DOIs, some of the significant challenges have been reduced.</p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/content-types-intro/books-and-chapters/\">Crossref</a> and <a href=\"http://www.metadata2020.org/blog/2020-03-17-metadata-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata 2020</a> offer best practices that make clear the need for richer metadata. It&rsquo;s also important to acknowledge the very real barriers to providing robust metadata, whether for book chapters or anything else, which is why having the conversations and being aware of available resources is important. Because, though it may be difficult, the hurdles are often up-front making the decision to invest in better metadata, factoring in associated costs, setting up workflows, etc.</p>\n<p>But as we have seen from the previous decades, book publishers and their suppliers are experts in managing substantial amounts of metadata. Just as no-one would argue to roll-back all those advantages, we believe that - once deployed - industry-wide creation and distribution of chapter data would be an advance from which there is no retreat.</p>\n<h4 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://riojournal.com/article/38698/\" target=\"_blank\">https://riojournal.com/article/38698/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8197625\" target=\"_blank\">The State of Open Monographs Report</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://longleafservices.org/blog/the-sustainable-history-monograph-pilot/\" target=\"_blank\">https://longleafservices.org/blog/the-sustainable-history-monograph-pilot/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/12/07/enriching-metadata-is-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/12/07/enriching-metadata-is-marketing/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ingenta.com/blog-article/five-reasons-chapter-level-metadata-increases-value-academic-books/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ingenta.com/blog-article/five-reasons-chapter-level-metadata-increases-value-academic-books/</a></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Memoirs of a DOI detective...it’s error-mentary dear members","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/memoirs-of-a-doi-detective...its-error-mentary-dear-members/","published":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Hello, I’m Paul Davis and I’ve been part of the Crossref support team since May 2017.

In that time I’ve become more adept as a DOI detective, helping our members work out <em>whodunnit</em> when it comes to submission errors.</p>\n<p>If you have ever received one of our error messages after you have submitted metadata to us, you may know that some are helpful and others are, well, difficult to decode. I&rsquo;m here to help you to become your own DOI detective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"motive-ridding-the-world-of-bad-metadata\">Motive: ridding the world of bad metadata</h3>\n<p>When depositing xml files to us, there can be a plethora of error messages returned to you in the submission logs. Wait, what are submission logs? If that is the first thing that came to mind, then you’re in the right place; do keep reading.</p>\n<h3 id=\"means-xml-deposits\">Means: XML deposits</h3>\n<p>After each content registration or update is received into our deposit admin system, it is initially placed in the submission queue and later, once its time comes, is processed. Whether that deposit comes from the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/webDeposit/\" target=\"_blank\">web deposit form</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata Manager</a>, or a good old fashioned <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/documentation/content-registration/metadata-deposit-schema/\">XML deposit</a>, a submission log is created in our system. This log contains important information about the deposit and its success or failures.</p>\n<p>I will go through how you will find and receive this log later on.\nAt the bottom of the submission log you will see a status message that looks like this:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code> &lt;batch_data&gt;\n&lt;record_count&gt;***&lt;/record_count&gt;\n&lt;success_count&gt;***&lt;/success_count&gt;\n&lt;warning_count&gt;***&lt;/warning_count&gt;\n&lt;failure_count&gt;***&lt;/failure_count&gt;\n&lt;/batch_data&gt;\n</code></pre><p>To some, this might look a bit like a crime scene. If the status report displays the same number in the <code>&lt;record_count&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;success_count&gt;</code>, then no crime (against deposits) has been committed. Everything you have tried to register or update has been successful and we are all free as DOI detectives to knock off early.</p>\n<p>At some point you will probably come across an error or failure in the submission logs, where the failure count is 1.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code> &lt;batch_data&gt;\n&lt;record_count&gt;1&lt;/record_count&gt;\n&lt;success_count&gt;0&lt;/success_count&gt;\n&lt;warning_count&gt;0&lt;/warning_count&gt;\n&lt;failure_count&gt;1&lt;/failure_count&gt;\n&lt;/batch_data&gt;\n</code></pre><p>For the purposes of this blog, this type of message means a <em>“crime”</em> has been committed. The worst kind of crime - a metadata crime. In the real world, outside of this blog, it just means that your deposit has failed and you need to take some action to fix it. You will also receive accompanying error messages (an evidence log) with details about what went wrong with your submission. We’ll deliver these submission details to you as well in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For those submitting via the web deposit form, to the email address used to register your submission</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On screen and within the admin tool using the submission ID for those submitting via Metadata Manager</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For those submitting XML, to the email included in the <code>&lt;email_address&gt;</code> element of your deposit XML</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can also find the submission log in the admin system at any point</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More information on <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/verify-your-registration/submission-queue-and-log/#00143\">viewing past deposits</a> in the admin system can be found on our support site.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-usual-suspects\">The usual suspects</h3>\n<p>Those serial offenders, when it comes to failed deposits, are:</p>\n<h4 id=\"timestamps\">Timestamps</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Misdemeanor</strong> - Every deposit has a <code>&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> value, and that value needs to be incremented each time the DOI is updated.

My apologies for the delay. I promised you an update in February as a follow up to the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/resolution-reports-a-look-inside-and-ahead/\">resolution reports blog</a> originally published in December by my colleague Jon Stark and me. Clearly we (I) missed that February projection, but I’m here today to provide said update. We received many great suggestions from our members as a result of the call for comments. For those of you who took time to write: thank you! We took extra time to review and evaluate all of your comments and recommendations. We have reached a decision about the major proposed change - removal of all filters from monthly resolution reports - as well as a couple of suggested improvements from that feedback.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quick-recap-of-our-original-blog\">Quick recap of our original blog</h3>\n<p>Jon wrote the original version of the resolution report in late 2009 in an effort to provide you, our members, with information about the usage of registered Crossref DOIs. At that time, Jon and others at Crossref thought it important to segment human-driven traffic from resolutions by machines (bots). Thus, we decided to filter out well-known machine activity in an attempt to only present you with resolutions by individual humans.</p>\n<p>In the last ten-plus years things changed. We live in a time where most of our work requires both human and machine interaction. Therefore, we have hypothesized that some, or most, of those resolutions from machines today represent legitimate activity and should be reported to you each month. Since we don’t have a reliable method to segment those resolutions, and don’t think we should be making judgments about which resolutions should and should not be included in the reports, we proposed removing all filters and presenting you with all the numbers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-we-heard-from-you\">What we heard from you</h3>\n<p>In addition to soliciting comments in the blog, I also reached out to all of our members who had written into our <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org?subject=changing%20resolution%20reports\">support desk</a> in the last year about anything related to resolution reports. We received dozens of responses from the blog and my outreach via email. The most common response was from members expressing their appreciation for and highlighting the utility of the reports. Most everyone told us how they were using the reports - from monitoring failure rates to mitigate issues to identifying trends over time. And a great number of respondents expressed concern that removing the filters might alter how or what we present to you in the reports (more on that soon). And, finally, several of you shared suggestions for improvement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"where-we-go-from-here\">Where we go from here</h3>\n<p>Our existing filters have been removing between 100 and 150 million resolutions from the monthly numbers we report to all members, collectively. Based on those figures, when we remove the filters all resolutions numbers will increase by about 25%. Those increased resolutions will vary from member to member because the numbers are based on actual bots crawling specific content, so some members may see more of an increase than others. We are mindful of how our members might adjust to that new baseline, since these changes will mean a noticeable (and, significant) increase in resolution totals for the majority of our members.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Total and Filtered_resolutions_18_19_OCT_new.png\" alt=\"Total and filtered resolutions\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<p>Outside of the suggested tweaks from members below and that 25% increase I mentioned (due to the retirement of the filters), the reports will remain unchanged. You’ll continue to receive successful resolutions, the report of top 10 DOIs, and the csv file containing failed resolutions. Our most important consideration throughout this process is that these reports continue to serve you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-changes\">The changes</h3>\n<p>We liked some of your suggestions, so we’re set to adopt a few of the more straightforward improvements. Those that are more complicated we’re considering for the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-manager-update/\">Member Center</a> (working title, subject to change) project, where we will start to bring together all business and technical information for our members, service providers and metadata users.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As I said, we’re removing the filters. Starting in June, we’ll present all of the resolutions to you. No filters. On average, monthly resolution numbers will therefore increase by about 25%.</li>\n<li>We currently link to the failed DOI.csv near the bottom of the resolution report. For many members with large volumes of content, the resolution report can take some time to load and sift through, so we’re moving the link to the failed DOI.csv file up the page (Note: we know they are other changes we can make to the report itself that will make it easier to work with for members with large volumes of data; we’re exploring those improvements).</li>\n<li>We learned during this process that some members were not receiving resolution reports when they only had failed resolutions. One of the aims of the reports is to help members identify content registration problems, so this was a bug we are keen to repair. We are fixing it. Once it is fixed, all members who have at least one resolution - successful or failed - during the previous month will receive the report.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"what-we-cant-change\">What we can&rsquo;t change</h3>\n<p>Many members who responded to the call and who also enquire throughout the year (outside of this call) express interest in receiving more information from the resolution reports. You want resolution numbers for all your DOIs. You want referral information about where the resolutions are coming from (e.g., IP addresses) and breakdowns by machine/human. You want more information about how and why the failure rate is growing over time. We understand.</p>\n<p>In the past, we did try to process more information for IP addresses and user agents but it turns out that generating that volume of extra data and processing monthly is simply impractical. The other issue is one of privacy. IP addresses are considered personally identifiable information (PII), or data that could potentially be used to identify particular people. We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our members and users and therefore cannot provide this level of granularity in our reports.</p>\n<h3 id=\"next-up\">Next up</h3>\n<p>Look for these changes starting in June. If you read this far, you may not need it, but we’ll also include a reminder atop the report itself about the increase in resolution totals as a result of our changes.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Free public data file of 112+ million Crossref records","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/free-public-data-file-of-112-million-crossref-records/","published":"Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"A lot of people have been using our public, open APIs to collect data that might be related to COVID-19.

To support this, as in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCRaWqkne_QqNs0BO78KGfjPFMDkpAQ-ky2nVynkuwc/edit#heading=h.xn4d62hlps6o\" target=\"_blank\">my initial proposal</a>, we’re adding a new <code>role</code> element and <code>role_type</code> attribute that supports existing Crossref-defined roles and CRediT roles, as well as a required <code>vocab</code> attribute to specify which vocabulary is being supplied.</p>\n<p><code>&lt;role role_type=&quot;author&quot; vocab=&quot;crossref&quot;&gt;author&lt;/role&gt; &lt;role role_type=&quot;writing-original_draft&quot; vocab=&quot;credit&quot;/&gt;</code></p>\n<p>CRediT as it exists now is an informal standard <a href=\"https://casrai.org/credit/\" target=\"_blank\">coordinated by CASRAI</a>, but a formal standard is <a href=\"https://niso.org/niso-io/2019/12/next-steps-toward-using-credit-credit\" target=\"_blank\">in the works via NISO</a>. CRediT is currently a list of well considered and defined roles that are not particularly machine-readable. I’ve created a list for implementation that eliminates spaces and ampersands. CRediT also lacks reliable PIDs or persistent URLs for the role definitions, so that has been omitted from our implementation. We’ll adopt any changes resulting from the NISO standard, but have decided to go forward with it as-is, as many of our members are eager to implement.</p>\n<p>Beyond CRediT, we’ll also be expanding and refining our contributor support in a number of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’ll be expanding our affiliation metadata beyond a simple string to include organization identifiers like <a href=\"https://ror.org\" target=\"_blank\">ROR</a>, and allow markup of organization names and locations.</li>\n<li>We’re expanding the contributor identifiers as well - in addition to ORCID iDs, members can send us Wikidata, ISNI, and other identifiers.</li>\n<li>We’re adding support for multiple names to support contributors whose names can be expressed in multiple alphabets, or who have aliases or nicknames.</li>\n<li>We’re changing <code>surname</code> to <code>family_name</code> and will be relaxing the requirement that all person names have a “surname” - a given name may be supplied on its own to support contributors who do not have family names.</li>\n<li>The current element for corporate/group authors, <code>organization</code>, will be replaced by <code>collab</code> as the term “organization” was widely confusing (we have a lot of affiliation info registered as group authors!), and the <code>collab</code> section will also allow organization identifiers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of these updates align with how <a href=\"https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">JATS</a> supports contributors - I hope these changes will allow our members to supply robust contributor metadata without the burden of complicated conversions.</p>\n<p>I’m also including the proposed changes to support data citation and typing of citations. Additionally, we’ll be adding support for members who want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>supply <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/content-types-intro/grants/\">Grant IDs</a> in their metadata records</li>\n<li>register <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/conferences-projects/\">identifiers for conferences</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A draft 5.0 xsd file is available in a branch of our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/schema/-/blob/5.0/5.0.update.md\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab schema repository</a> with the details of the planned updates, and more robust documentation and examples are forthcoming.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation-plans\">Implementation plans</h2>\n<p>My house was built in 1890 and there are always surprises whenever we need to fix or renovate anything. Our system is just as old in technology years - it’s been chugging along since the aughts. This means while we don’t think it’s powered by knob-and-tube wiring, we can’t be sure until we open up the walls. We want to implement our plans (in fact we want to do more!) but if we run into any big blockers or crucial issues, we may roll out the changes over several iterations. These updates are fairly conservative and I remain optimistic we’ll be able to implement them as-is. Our update will help us build a foundation for future updates, allowing us to continuously evolve our schema as we move forward.</p>\n<p>Some of you are understandably worried about our implementation schedule and backwards incompatibility. We’re aware that changes are expensive and inconvenient, and making them on our schedule doesn’t always work for your schedule. That’s why we’ve sustained 12+ versions of our schema over the past 12 years. We won’t be mandating a change any time soon, and definitely won’t do so without sufficient warning and community involvement. In the future we’ll need to make a sustained effort to retire older schema, but now isn’t the time for that.</p>\n<p>We intend to commence work in Q2 but won’t have a firm timeline for a few more weeks. I will be providing regular updates as we progress, and will be asking for volunteers to test the updates when we’re ready. I’ll also be sharing more documentation and information about how the changes will be represented in our metadata outputs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-more-to-say\">Have more to say?</h2>\n<p>Our feedback period has finished and we do plan to implement the changes as described, but if you have opinions, please <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">share them</a>.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Encouraging even greater reporting of corrections and retractions","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/encouraging-even-greater-reporting-of-corrections-and-retractions/","published":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000","description":"TL;DR: We no longer charge fees for members to participate in Crossmark, and we encourage all our members to register metadata about corrections and retractions - even if you can’t yet add the Crossmark...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Kirsty Meddings","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>TL;DR: We no longer charge fees for members to participate in Crossmark, and we encourage all our members to register metadata about corrections and retractions - even if you can’t yet add the Crossmark button and pop-up box to your landing pages or PDFs.</p>\n<p>&ndash;</p>\n<p>Research doesn’t stand still; even after publication, articles can be updated with supplementary data or corrections.

The REST API takes priority over Event Data because we need to add support for important new content types (like Grants) that aren&rsquo;t yet available via the API.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re also concluding the process of hiring two new Product Managers which means we&rsquo;ll be in a position to assign someone to head up the product management of Event Data.

This missing DOI case was unlike any other before, keeping him awake for many seconds already. It took a great effort and a good amount of help from his clever assistant Fuzzy Comparison to make sense of the sparse clues provided by Miss Unstructured Reference, an elegant young lady with a shy smile, who begged him to take up this case at any cost.</p>\n<p>The final confrontation was about to happen, the detective could feel it, and his intuition rarely misled him in the past. He was observing DOI <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/257306\" target=\"_blank\"><code>10.2307/257306</code></a>, which matched Miss Reference&rsquo;s description very well. So far, there was no indication that DOI had any idea he was being observed. He was leaning on a wall across the street in a seemingly nonchalant way, just about to put out his cigarette. Empty dark streets and slowly falling snow together created an excellent opportunity to capture the fugitive.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Matcher heard a faint rustling sound. Out of nowhere, another shady figure, looking very much like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.1982.4285592\" target=\"_blank\"><code>10.5465/amr.1982.4285592</code></a>, appeared in front of the detective, crossed the street and started running away. Matcher couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. These two DOIs had identical authors, year and title. They were even wearing identical volume and issue! He quickly noticed minor differences: slight alteration in the journal title and lack of the second page number in one of the DOIs, but this was likely just a random mutation. How could have he missed the other DOI? And more importantly, which of them was the one worried Miss Reference simply couldn&rsquo;t live without?</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/duplicates_cover.jpg\"/>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Crossref metadata contains duplicates, i.e. items with different DOIs and identical (or almost identical) bibliographic metadata. This often happens when there is more than one DOI pointing to the same object. In some cases, but not all of them, one of the DOIs is explicitly marked as an alias of the other DOI.</li>\n<li>In this blog post, I analyze those duplicates, that are not marked with an alias relation. <strong>The analysis shows that the problem exists, but is not big</strong>.</li>\n<li>Among 524,496 DOIs tested in the analysis, 4,240 (0.8%) were flagged as having non-aliased duplicates. I divided those duplicates into two categories:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Self-duplicate</strong> is a duplicate deposited by the same member as the other DOI, there were 3,603 (85%) of them.</li>\n<li><strong>Other-duplicate</strong> is a duplicate deposited by a different member than the other DOI&rsquo;s depositor, there were only 637 (15%) of them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I used three member-level metrics to estimate the volume of duplicates deposited by a given member:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Self-duplicate index</strong> is the fraction of self-duplicates in member&rsquo;s DOIs: on average 0.67%.</li>\n<li><strong>Other-duplicate</strong> index is the fraction of other-duplicates in a member&rsquo;s DOIs: on average 0.13%.</li>\n<li><strong>Global other-duplicate index</strong> is the fraction of globally detected other-duplicates involving a given member: on average 0.34%.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>In an ideal world, the relationship between research outputs and DOIs is one-to-one: every research output has exactly one DOI assigned and each DOI points to exactly one research output.</p>\n<p>As we all know too well, we do not live in a perfect world, and this one-to-one relationship is also sometimes violated. One way to violate it is to assign more than one DOI to the same object. This can cause problems.</p>\n<p>First of all, if there are two DOIs referring to the same object, eventually they both might end up in different systems and datasets. As a result, merging data between data sources becomes an issue, because we no longer can rely on comparing the DOI strings only.</p>\n<p>Reference matching algorithms will also be confused when they encounter more than one DOI matching the input reference. They might end up assigning one DOI from the matching ones at random, or not assigning any DOI at all.</p>\n<p>And finally, more than one DOI assigned to one object is hugely problematic for document-level metrics such as citation counts, and eventually affects h-indexes and impact factors. In practice, metrics are typically calculated per DOI, so when there are two DOIs pointing to one document, the citation count might be split between them, effectively lowering the count, and making every academic author&rsquo;s biggest nightmare come true.</p>\n<p>It seems we shouldn&rsquo;t simply cover our eyes and pretend this problem does not exist. So what are we doing at Crossref to make the situation better?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is possible for our members to explicitly mark a DOI as an alias of another DOI, if it was deposited by mistake. This does not remove the problem, but at least allows metadata consumers to access and use this information.</li>\n<li>Whenever a DOI is registered or updated in Crossref, we automatically compare its metadata to the metadata of existing DOIs. If the metadata is too similar to the metadata of another DOI, this information is sent to the member and they have a chance to modify the metadata as they see fit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these efforts, we still see duplicates that are not explained by anything in the metadata. In this blog post, I will try to understand this problem better and assess how big it is. I also define three member-level metrics that can show how much a given member contributes to duplicates in the system and can flag members with unusually high fractions of duplicates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gathering-the-data\">Gathering the data</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The data for this analysis was collected in the following way:</li>\n<li>Only journal articles were considered in the analysis.</li>\n<li>Only members with at least 5,000 journal article DOIs were considered in the analysis.</li>\n<li>For each member, a random sample of 1,000 journal article DOIs was selected.</li>\n<li>DOIs with no title, title shorter than 20 characters or shorter than 3 words were removed from each sample. This was done because items with short titles typically result in incorrectly flagged duplicates (false positives).</li>\n<li>For each remaining DOI in the sample, a simple string representation was generated. This representation is a concatenation of the following fields: authors, title, container-title, volume, issue, page, published date.</li>\n<li>This string representation was used as <code>query.bibliographic</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref&rsquo;s REST API</a> and the resulting item list was examined.</li>\n<li>If the original DOI came back as the first or the second hit, the relevance score difference between the first two hits is less than 1, they are both journal articles, and there is no relation (alias or otherwise) between them, the other one of the two is considered a duplicate of the original DOI. The score difference threshold was chosen through a manual examination of a number of cases. Most detected duplicates came back scored identically.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"overall-results\">Overall results</h2>\n<p>In total, I tested 590 members and 524,496 DOIs. Among them, 4,240 DOIs (0.8%) were flagged as duplicates of other DOIs. This shows the problem exists, but is not huge.</p>\n<p>I also analyzed separately two categories of duplicates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>self-duplicates</strong> are two DOIs with (almost) identical metadata, deposited by the same member,</li>\n<li><strong>other-duplicates</strong> are two DOIs with (almost) identical metadata, deposited by two different members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Self-duplicates are more common: 3,603 (85%) of all detected duplicates are self-duplicates, and only 637 (15%) are other-duplicates. This is also good news: self-duplicates involve one member only, so they are easier to handle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"self-duplicates\">Self-duplicates</h2>\n<p>To explore the levels of self-duplicates among members, I used a custom member-level metric called self-duplicate index. <strong>Self-duplicate index</strong> is the fraction of self-duplicates among the member&rsquo;s DOIs, in this case calculated over a sample.</p>\n<p>On average, members have a very small self-duplicate index of 0.67%.

It is also worrying that Informa UK Limited, a member that shares 51 other-duplicates flagged in Maney Publishing&rsquo;s sample, was not flagged by this index. The reason might be differences in the overall number of registered DOIs: two members that deposited the same number of other-duplicates, but have different overall numbers of registered DOIs, will have different other-duplicate indexes.</p>\n<p>To address this issue, I looked at a third index called global other-duplicate index. <strong>Global other-duplicate index</strong> is the fraction of globally detected other-duplicates involving a given member.</p>\n<p>Global other-duplicate index has a useful interpretation: it tells us how much the overall number of other-duplicates would drop, if the given member resolved all its other-duplicates (for example by setting appropriate relations or correcting the metadata so that it is no longer so similar).</p>\n<p>Here is the list of members with global-duplicate index higher than 2%:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Total DOIs</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Global other-duplicate index</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>JSTOR</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,612,174</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">69%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>American Bryological and Lichenological Society</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">5,593</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">54%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Informa UK Limited</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">4,275,507</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maney Publishing</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">15,342</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>American Mathematical Society (AMS)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">83,015</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Project Muse</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">326,300</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wiley</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">8,003,815</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elsevier BV</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">16,268,943</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Liverpool University Press</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">31,870</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cambridge University Press (CUP)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,621,713</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2,152,723</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>University of Toronto Press Inc.

It’s true that there has been constant change, but there has been another constant at Crossref –– me (and DOIs, to be fair). I started as Crossref’s first employee and Executive Director on February 1st, 2000, so I just marked my <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/news/2000-02-02-journal-reference-linking-service-names-executive-director-board-of-directors-new-members-and-a-go-live-timetable/\">20th anniversary with the organization</a>.</p>\n<p>This milestone prompted me to reflect on where I am and where I’m heading. After 20 years leading the organization, I’ve decided to leave Crossref. It’s time for a new challenge. I’m still very committed to the mission and very proud of my time at Crossref, the culture we’ve created and what the organization has achieved. It’s been an honor serving as Executive Director and a pleasure working with so many great people over the years. And to be clear –– I’m not ill, being pushed or having a midlife crisis (yet).</p>\n<p>It’s a difficult and emotional decision but I think the transition can be positive for me, the staff, the board, and the organization. I’ll be working with the Crossref board, Chair, Treasurer and staff on the transition –– the plan is for me to be around through September or October to enable the recruitment and handover to a new Executive Director. There will be more information about the transition and recruitment process after the Crossref board meeting March 11-12 in London.</p>\n<p>Crossref has a bright future and many opportunities to do new things. Crossref provides essential, open scholarly infrastructure and services that benefit its members and the wider scholarly research ecosystem –– and we’ve got a lot of interesting things in development and ambitious plans. To anyone who might be interested in being Crossref’s next Executive Director, I can honestly say it is fantastic, challenging, fun, and very fulfilling –– that’s why I’ve done it for 20 years.</p>\n<p>What’s next for me? I don’t know but it’s something I’ll be thinking about over the coming months.

Serhii has a Ph.D. in Social Communication Science. His research interests lie in the area of scientometrics and library science. Serhii is the Associate Editor for DOAJ (<a href=\"http://www.doaj.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.doaj.org</a>) and the Regional Editor for E-LIS (Eprints in Library and Information Science). Serhii has worked in different scientific libraries of Ukraine for more than 10 years. Tetiana Borysova is a Senior Researcher at the State Scientific and Technical Library of Ukraine. Her research interests are focused on topics such as research data management, journal management and scientometrics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-ouci\">Introducing OUCI</h2>\n<p>OUCI (<a href=\"http://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Ukrainian Citation Index</a>) is a new search engine and a citation database based on publication metadata from Crossref members.</p>\n<p>OUCI is intended to simplify the search of scientific publications, to attract the editors&rsquo; attention to the problem of completeness and quality of the metadata of Ukrainian scholarly publications, and will allow bibliometricians to freely study the relations between authors and documents from various disciplines, in particular in the field of social sciences and humanities. OUCI is open for every user in the world without any restrictions.</p>\n<p>OUCI launched in November 2019. The project is being implemented by the <a href=\"https://dntb.gov.ua/en/science\" target=\"_blank\">State Scientific and Technical Library of Ukraine</a> with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>In Ukraine, we do not have a national citation database, and this significantly impedes the search and analysis of information about Ukrainian publications. According to preliminary estimates, more than 3,000 titles of scientific journals are currently published in Ukraine. At the same time, only around 100 Ukrainian journal titles are indexed in authoritative citation databases, such as Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection. Thus, researchers and managers lack this citation data to understand the impact of Ukrainian journals and their demand in the scientific communication system. Our approach is that OUCI database contains metadata from all publishers that use the Crossref&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/\">Cited-by</a> service and who support the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Initiative for Open Citations</a> by making the reference metadata they publish with Crossref openly available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-crossref-metadata-used-in-ouci\">How is Crossref metadata used in OUCI?</h2>\n<p>A publication can only be indexed in OUCI if there is a DOI. At first glance, the idea of creating an index of national publications based on this condition may seem too optimistic. However, in January 2018, a new requirement was adopted by the <a href=\"https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/main/z0148-18\" target=\"_blank\">List of scientific publications of Ukraine</a> (a list of Ukrainian journals recognized by experts as qualitative for publishing their research results for a scientific degree), which listed a DOI as one of the requirements for inclusion. After that, the number of publishers who received the DOI prefix from Crossref has tripled, to 352 in November 2019.</p>\n<p>Another important feature of OUCI is that publishers have to use Crossref&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/\">Cited-by</a> service and support the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Initiative for Open Citations.</a> We are working to build a new fair infrastructure where everyone who is interested in the dissemination of scientific knowledge can present their publications to the community, develop expert judgment skills and access citations to explore the links between documents. The philosophy of the index is to use only open resources to fill it.</p>\n<p>In addition to standard filters from Crossref metadata (such as publisher, publication, type, year), OUCI offers to refine search results by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>indexation in Web of Science and/or Scopus,</li>\n<li>journal category (A or B according to the List of scientific publications of Ukraine),</li>\n<li>the field of knowledge and scientific specialties (according to the Ukrainian legislation) and other aspects important to Ukrainian users characteristics.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/ouci_blog_filters.png\"\nalt=\"Figure 1: OUCI search and filter options\" width=\"75%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Figure 1: OUCI search and filter options</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Beyond the ability to search articles, OUCI displays profiles for Ukrainian journals (the titles of these journals will include hyperlinks in the search results). Administrators can manage them, add and edit information about their journals: web-site, aims and scope, scientific fields of the journal according to the Ukrainian classification. Also, you can see some quantitative characteristics of journals: number of publications, number of citations, h-index, i10-index etc.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/ouci_blog_profiles.png\"\nalt=\"Figure 2: Display of journal information in OUCI\" width=\"75%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Figure 2: Display of journal information in <a href=\"http://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/editions/xmnGEm0L/\" target=\"_blank\">OUCI</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In addition, we have implemented an analytics module. Using the data about the number of articles and citations from Crossref, it allows users to analyze Ukrainian journals by field.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/ouci_blog_analysis.png\"\nalt=\"Figure 3: Publication and citation information\" width=\"75%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Figure 3: Publication and citation information</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-future-plans-for-ouci\">What are the future plans for OUCI?</h2>\n<p>In the near future, we plan to add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the ability to export search results for further analysis;</li>\n<li>integration with <a href=\"https://unpaywall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Unpaywall</a>;</li>\n<li>alternative metrics from <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/terms/\">Crossref Event Data</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the ideal future for our index, every Ukrainian article will be registered with Crossref and have open references. We plan to promote the importance of reach and quality metadata in Crossref among Ukrainian publishers. We also encourage all publishers to support the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Initiative for Open Citations</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-would-ouci-like-to-see-in-crossref-metadata\">What else would OUCI like to see in Crossref metadata?</h2>\n<p>One of the main problems we encountered when creating OUCI was the metadata about the authors. Very few publications contain data about the author&rsquo;s ORCID iD. Focusing publishers on the need to transmit full metadata to Crossref, as well as monitoring their quality is a must for the resources like this. Also we look forward to the growing usage of ROR (<a href=\"https://ror.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Research Organization Registry</a>) - identifiers for research organizations, similar to the way that ORCID offers identifiers for researchers. We believe that the ROR will help to obtain reliable data for analyzing the scientific activity of Ukrainian institutions.</p>\n<p>Another issue we&rsquo;ve identified in some Ukrainian journals that some of the small publishers that register content via Crossref Sponsors did not take care getting their own prefix, so it can be difficult to see their publications - this is something that showing the metadata via an index can help them see and therefore fix.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questions\">Questions?</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve had lots of questions about OUCI in the run up to the launch and now that it&rsquo;s live. Here is a selection of our FAQs, <a href=\"http://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/about/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">all available on our website</a>.

This means that Crossref will be 20 years old on January 19th, 2020 so I wanted to mark the occasion with a short post. We are planning more ways to mark our 20th anniversary later this year so keep a lookout.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/crossref_20anniv_logo_RGB.png\" alt=\"20th anniversary logo\" width=\"50% class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<p>Crossref becoming a legal entity was the result of developments over the previous few years and the DOI-X pilot in 1999. Moving quickly, the fledgling organization issued its first news release on February 2nd, 2000 - <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/news/2000-02-02-journal-reference-linking-service-names-executive-director-board-of-directors-new-members-and-a-go-live-timetable/\">Crossref Update Journal Reference Linking Service Names Executive Director, Board of Directors, New Members, and a “Go Live” Timetable</a> - announcing the appointment of an Executive Director (me!), that there were 22 members, and a plan for launching the system. From these beginnings, Crossref has grown into one of the most successful examples of sustainable scholarly infrastructure. This is due to the hard work and support of many people and organizations, and an organizational structure and governance and sustainability model that has proven very robust.</p>\n<p>Looking back, Crossref has achieved an amazing amount but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t a forgone conclusion that we would be successful. On our tenth anniversary we wrote an overview of Crossref&rsquo;s founding and early years <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/CrossRef10Years.pdf\">The Formation of Crossref: A Short History</a>, which highlights that vision, collaboration, trust and utility all contributed to Crossref&rsquo;s success. I particularly want to recognize Eric Swanson, from Wiley, and Pieter Bolman, from Academic Press/Harcourt Brace for their critical role in the founding of Crossref and in its early success by providing the vision, bringing everyone together, serving as the first Chair and Treasurer of the organization, and providing me with support and guidance in Crossref&rsquo;s early start-up phase.</p>\n<p>Our history document notes that Crossref grew more quickly than expected, &ldquo;By the end of 2003, CrossRef had 300 members with 12 million DOIs assigned, compared to the initial projection of 60 participating publishers and 3 million DOIs assigned.&rdquo; Looking at the 2010 annual report at the ten year mark, Crossref had 43 million content items, 943 members and 15 staff. Since then, Crossref has continued to grow faster than expected and, in fact, at the start of of 20th year, growth is increasing. Our latest annual report <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/y8ygwm5\" target=\"_blank\">“Crossref Annual Report &amp; Fact File 2018-19”</a> highlights that there we have 111 million content items - an average annual increase of 15%; over 11,500 members with over 180 joining per month - an average annual increase of 112%; and 37 staff - an average annual increase of 7%. Crossref is also financially stable, having generated surpluses every year since 2003 and with no fee increases in 15 years - an effective 30%+ decrease for members.</p>\n<p>Some of the most important statistics for me are those around DOI resolutions - humans and machines following persistent DOI links - and metadata dissemination via our open APIs and paid services. In 2010 there were around 470 million DOI resolutions for the entire year - we now see over 400 million resolutions per month. With metadata dissemination in 2010 there were on average about 40 million queries per month and there are now over 600 million per month meaning that huge amounts of metadata are flowing out into the ecosystem and improving persistent linking, discovery, and the research process. Also, very importantly, we are much more global and diverse than we were, with members and users from over 120 countries, representing all disciplines and all types of organizations (societies, commercial publishers, funders, start-ups, universities and other research institutions). And in a big change, the members in the top three fee categories accounted for 36% of revenue in 2019 - down from 56% in 2011, while the bottom three categories accounted for 46% of revenue in 2019 - up from 25% in 2011.</p>\n<p>As we noted in our blog post from November 2019, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-turning-point-is-a-time-for-reflection/\">A turning point is a time for reflection</a>, &ldquo;different people have always wanted different things from us and, since our founding, we have brought together diverse organizations to have discussions&mdash;sometimes contentious&mdash;to agree on how to help make scholarly communications better. Being inclusive can mean slow progress, but we’ve been able to advance by being flexible, fair, and forward-thinking.&rdquo; While we&rsquo;ve been very successful, there is a lot we can do better and it is tricky keeping all our stakeholders happy - but that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve always done and we&rsquo;ll continue to do it by being open, inclusive, collaborative, and willing to change and adapt. The one constant in Crossref&rsquo;s 20 years has been change. The staff and board will be reviewing Crossref&rsquo;s strategy in 2020 with the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RsqtnHssBkaFNphdWoq20_ewruYP04n8j_dYB9wvphM/edit#slide=id.g65af51c04a_1_238\" target=\"_blank\">value research report</a> and LIVE19 Amsterdam workshops as input.

For the most part, this is a one-time process.  You enter the metadata, register your DOI, and success!</p>\n<p>But everything doesn&rsquo;t always go quite as expected. Humans make mistakes, and typos in metadata are bound to happen on occasion, even for the most careful users.</p>\n<p>We always want to make it as easy as possible for our members to find and correct metadata errors, and to add additional metadata when it becomes available.  Our <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213197406-Schematron-report\" target=\"_blank\">Schematron</a>, <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213197206-Conflict-report\" target=\"_blank\">Conflict</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/resolution-reports-a-look-inside-and-ahead/\">Resolution</a> reports can help you identify existing metadata errors. We never charge content registration fees for metadata updates, additions, or corrections, so cost won&rsquo;t be a barrier to getting the most accurate and thorough metadata possible.  And, now, Metadata Manager can make those corrections easier to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"correcting-errors\">Correcting Errors</h2>\n<p>Because accurate and comprehensive metadata is so important for the linking and discoverability of your publications, it&rsquo;s important to catch these occasional errors and correct them.</p>\n<p>We send out <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213197406-Schematron-report\" target=\"_blank\">reports that automatically screen for particular types of metadata errors</a>, and we pass along comments from users who contact us with concerns about metadata quality to our contacts at the relevant publisher. </p>\n<p>The &ldquo;Review all&rdquo; feature in Metadata Manager also allows you to do a final check of all the metadata you entered right before you&rsquo;re about to submit your deposits.  So, we also rely on you to evaluate your own accuracy there as well.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/metadata manager review.png\" alt=\"Metadata Manager Review All\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<p>Once you’ve identified an error, you’ll need to correct it. To do that, you must resubmit a whole new metadata deposit for the affected item. The newly deposited metadata will entirely overwrite the previously deposited metadata.</p>\n<p>If you’re used to using the Web Deposit Form, you know that the redeposit can be a little tedious. For example, if you find that you misspelled an author’s last name, you’d have to manually type in or copy-paste not just the corrected last name, but all of the journal-level, issue-level, and article-level metadata that applies to the article.</p>\n<p>Using Metadata Manager, the process is much simpler. The full metadata record is retained or imported and you only need to correct the error itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-articles-originally-registered-using-metadata-manager\">For articles originally registered using Metadata Manager</h3>\n<p>If you find a metadata error in an article which you initially registered in Metadata Manager itself, you can locate the article in one of two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate through the list of Accepted articles within a given journal</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/Metadata Manager Accepted Articles.png\" alt=\"Metadata Manager Accepted Articles\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Or, search by article title in the Deposit History</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/Metadata Manager Deposit History.png\" alt=\"Metadata Manager Deposit History\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<p>Once you’ve located the relevant article, click on the article title to open the article’s metadata record. From there, you can make the necessary corrections. With the corrections complete, click “Continue” and then “Add to deposit.” After that, the process is exactly the same as depositing a new article.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-articles-registered-using-the-web-deposit-form-or-any-other-deposit-method\">For articles registered using the Web Deposit Form or any other deposit method</h3>\n<p>If you registered an article using the Web Deposit Form, an XML deposit, or the OJS plugin, you can still use Metadata Manager to quickly correct an error. But, first you have to import the article’s metadata into Metadata Manager.</p>\n<p>To do this, click into the relevant journal from your Metadata Manager home page. Then, search for the article title using the “Add existing article” search box. Select “Add” next to the article title in the search results, which will import the article’s metadata record into Metadata Manager.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/metadata manager search.png\" alt=\"Metadata Manager Article Search\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<p>From here, make any necessary corrections and click “Continue” and then “Add to deposit.” Navigate to the “To deposit” tab and “Review all” to ensure that your metadata record is accurate. Then select “Deposit” to finalize your submission. You’ll receive immediate feedback as to whether your metadata deposit was successful or not.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2020/Metadata Manager deposit submission.png\" alt=\"Metadata Manager Deposit Submission\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<h2 id=\"adding-additional-metadata\">Adding additional metadata</h2>\n<p>Perhaps there are no problems with your metadata, and everything is completely accurate.  That&rsquo;s great! But, we encourage our members to submit metadata that is not just accurate, but also as thorough as possible.  Check your <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">Participation Report</a> to see if there are any types of metadata that you haven&rsquo;t been submitting yet, or that you haven&rsquo;t been submitting for certain journals.</p>\n<p>Metadata Manager allows you to deposit references, licenses, and relationships between your articles and other DOIs, which weren’t possible to add using the Web Deposit Form. The same process described above for corrections will allow you to import previously registered articles and add in these new metadata elements.</p>\n<p>We also know that many of our members register DOIs for their articles when they’re first published online, but aren’t yet included in an issue. When the articles are published in their final versions, there is important metadata added which wasn’t yet available when the DOI was first registered. This includes things like volume number, issue number, page numbers, and full publication date, all of which are extremely important for linking and discoverability. Sometimes the resolution URL changes when the article is moved from its pre-publication status to its final version.</p>\n<p>So, when each issue is published, you can use Metadata Manager to pull up all the already-registered articles included in that issue and add in the newly relevant metadata like page numbers, issue number, URL, etc. Then add them to a new deposit, review, and submit.</p>\n<p>Please check out the full <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/member-setup/metadata-manager/\">Metadata Manager help documentation</a> for more details, or join us on an <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/webinars/\">upcoming workshop</a> to test out Metadata Manager in real-time with us.  And, as always, feel free to email us at <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support@crossref.org</a> with any questions.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Resolution reports: a look inside and ahead","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/resolution-reports-a-look-inside-and-ahead/","published":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Isaac Farley, technical support manager, and Jon Stark, software developer, provide a glimpse into the history and current state of our popular monthly resolution reports.

They invite you, our members, to help us understand how you use these reports. This will help us determine the best next steps for further improvement of these reports, and particularly what we do and don’t filter out of them.</p>\n<p>Isaac joined Crossref in April 2018. Before that, he was with one of our members, a geoscience society in Oklahoma (USA). As a Crossref member, like all of our members, he received the resolution reports to his inbox during the first week of each month. And like many of you, he had questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What exactly is this report?</li>\n<li>What are all these numbers?</li>\n<li>Now, what about those 10 top DOIs is making them so popular?</li>\n<li>Why are some of these DOIs failing?</li>\n<li>And, what’s with this filtering of “known search engine crawlers?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that Isaac is the Crossref Technical Support Manager, instead of asking these questions, he answers many of them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whoatoo-fastwhat-exactly-are-resolution-reports\">Whoa&hellip;too fast&hellip;what exactly are resolution reports?</h3>\n<p>The resolution report provides an overview of DOI resolution traffic, and can identify problems with your DOI links. The failed DOI.csv linked to your resolution report email contains a list of all DOIs with failed resolution attempts (more on this later). If a user clicks on a DOI with your DOI prefix and the DOI is not registered, it won’t resolve to a web page, and thus will appear on your report.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-those-numbers\">What are those numbers?</h3>\n<p>This is always a good starting point for wrangling statistical information. Resolution statistics are based on the number of DOI resolutions made through the <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DOI proxy server</a> on a month-by-month basis. These statistics give an indication of the traffic generated by users - both human and machine - clicking (or, resolving) DOIs. CNRI (the organization that manages the DOI proxy server) sends us resolution logs at the end of every month and we pass the data on to you.</p>\n<p>Resolution reports are sent by default to the business contact on your account, and we can always add or change the recipient(s) as needed. We send a separate report for each DOI prefix you’re responsible for.</p>\n<p>Historically we have done our best to filter out obvious crawlers and machine activity - thus valuing human-driven traffic to traffic generated by machines. That sentence above about those obvious crawlers is the real reason we are here today blogging.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-are-some-of-those-dois-failing\">Why are some of those DOIs failing?</h3>\n<p>The ideal failure rate is 0%. A failure rate of 0% would mean that every DOI you owned that was clicked in the previous month successfully resolved to the resolution URL you registered with us. But, in reality, a 0% failure rate is rare, because any string of characters that is combined with your prefix (e.g., 10.5555/ThisIsNOTARealDOI) and attempted to be resolved will go through the resolver and result in another single failed count toward your monthly resolution report. If you are new to Crossref, or have only deposited metadata for a small number of content items, you may have a high failure percentage (for example, 2 failures and 8 successes = 20% failure rate).</p>\n<p>Before 2019, the overall resolution failure rate across all publishers held fairly steady each month between 2 and 4%. You may have noticed that that number has been climbing this year. And, as a result, we think a new normal is closer to 10%.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/resolutions_unfiltered_table_new.png\" alt=\"Total resolutions unfiltered\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/resolutions_percentage_rate_chart_new.png\" alt=\"Unfiltered resolution failure rate\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<p>Given this new norm, if your overall resolution failure rate is higher than 8 to 12%, we advise you to look closely at the failed DOI.csv file that we include in the monthly report we email you. The first step in your analysis of this portion of the report is to make sure the DOIs listed have been registered. Very often failures of legitimate DOIs are the result of content registration errors or workflow inefficiencies (i.e., DOIs are shared with the editorial team and/or contributors before being registered with us, leading to premature clicks). If during your investigation, you find invalid DOIs (like the example above: 10.5555/ThisIsNOTARealDOI) - and you will find invalid DOIs because we all make mistakes when resolving DOIs - you may simply ignore those DOIs within the report.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-with-this-filtering-of-known-search-engine-crawlers\">What’s with this filtering of “known search engine crawlers?”</h3>\n<p>You may have recently noticed that we made a few changes to the resolution reports. We merged, rearranged, and in some cases completely rewrote the report you receive to your inboxes, because, well, it needed it. It was confusing. Parts of the report still are. Most specifically, those “known search engine crawlers.” To that point, you may have also noticed that the reports that arrived to your inboxes in early November 2019 were scrubbed of nearly 150 million resolutions across all members.</p>\n<p>Based on Jon’s analysis of these 150 million filtered resolutions, they were from bots. In the past, it was important to filter out bots, as we found our community was most focused on human readers. But should we be filtering out resolutions from bots any more? We live in a time where most of our work (at least in the Crossref community) requires both human and machine interaction; thus, aren’t at least some of these resolutions from machines legitimate?</p>\n<p>Our internal analysis shows that we cannot reliably determine which usage is from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual humans;</li>\n<li>Machines acting as intermediaries between researchers and DOIs;</li>\n<li>Internet service providers with real human users behind them; or,</li>\n<li>Bots that do not result in actual human usage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, it is our thinking that we may serve you better by not filtering any traffic, as we cannot guarantee that we’re removing the right things. We feel that it may be better for us to just give you everything we know. And invite you to make your own judgments.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Total_resolutions_18_19_OCT_new.png\" alt=\"Total resolutions last year\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Filtered_resolutions_18_19_OCT_new.png\" alt=\"Filtered resolutions last year\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Total and Filtered_resolutions_18_19_OCT_new.png\" alt=\"Total and filtered resolutions\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<h3 id=\"howd-we-get-here\">How&rsquo;d we get here?</h3>\n<p>Jon joined Crossref in 2004. He wrote the original version of the resolution report in late 2009 in an effort to provide you, our members, with information about the usage of registered Crossref DOIs. At that time, most members were creating DOIs, but then had no real feedback about the traffic that was getting to their content (via the DOI proxy server lookups of their DOIs). These reports filled that gap. The other benefit of the report was the information it provided about failed resolutions. As suggested above, the list of failed resolutions helped members identify potential problems with the content registration process.</p>\n<p>A DOI that appeared on the report as a failed resolution could be cause of concern for the member. But, then again, humans and machines make mistakes when attempting to resolve DOIs (e.g., typos). Thus, not much has changed in the last ten years - the DOIs that appear in the failed resolution reports must be evaluated. Care should especially be taken when a DOI that should have been registered has not and appears as a failed resolution (e.g., data problem, agent behind on deposits, etc.) within this report.</p>\n<p>Like we said, mistakes happen. Users may enter a DOI incorrectly when looking it up. Or, it could be a bot throwing randomly generated traffic that looks like a DOI, but is not. And, sometimes bots are scraping through PDFs for DOIs and simply extract them incorrectly. These are all user errors, and not necessarily a concern for our members. That’s why we provide that list of what failed.</p>\n<p>At the start, there were a few well known crawlers that were resolving large numbers of DOIs regularly. It was our opinion at the time that it would be helpful to filter that usage since we assumed members only cared about human-driven traffic. As the next decade passed, it became clear that the internet had and would continue to change. With bots popping up every day and IP addresses moving or spanning broad address ranges (and IPs we had already filtered with the potential of being repurposed), it was obvious that we would always miss as much as we caught.</p>\n<p>Between the constantly changing landscape and the fact that real usage can be hidden behind IP addresses that appear like bot traffic, we no longer have confidence in our filtering process. It may be best for our users to just get the data as the data exists and know that our metadata world covers a vast range of usages - many as valid and valuable today as that human-driven traffic we prioritized ten years ago. Perhaps there is some other metric we can provide that might be useful for understanding the traffic in better ways, but filtering some of this traffic seems no longer useful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"your-help-with-next-steps\">Your help with next steps</h3>\n<p>There you have it. Our thinking: we’ve been filtering these resolution reports the best we can for ten years. Today, our confidence in the filtering process has waned. We’re proposing a change: we want to give you the raw resolution numbers, for machines and humans alike. We want to make this change soon, but we also want to hear from you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How are you using the resolution reports?</li>\n<li>What you do you think of this proposed change?</li>\n<li>Will our removal of all filters from monthly resolution reports affect how you use the information within?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to hear from you, and we’re inviting you to help us determine our next steps. We are going to give you until Friday, 31 January to <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org?subject=Filtering%20resolution%20reports\">tell us</a> what you think of this proposed change. Then, Isaac and Jon will be back in early February to share with you what you have helped us decide.

After almost two years of continuous learning, I think it is worth sharing my experience with the Crossref community for a better understanding of the ambassadors&rsquo; role in Latin America and to inspire ambassadors from other parts of the world to write and post their experiences.</p>\n<p>Before becoming a Crossref ambassador, I had already been working with Crossref since 2011, when we started to coordinate DOI registration for the Biomédica Journal of the National Health Institute, one of the first journals to implement the DOI in Colombia. During these first years of relations with Crossref, I acquired basic knowledge on membership and the technical aspects of the services the agency offers, including <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/reference-linking\">Reference Linking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration\">Content Registration</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark\">Crossmark</a>. This close relationship with Crossref enabled us to hold the PKP-Crossref workshop in 2018 with Juan Pablo Alperín and Susan Collins at the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200316022408/http://congreso.redalyc.org/ocs/public/congresoEditores/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Third International Congress of Redalyc Editors at Universidad César Vallejo, city of Trujillo</a>.</p>\n<p>In the same year, thanks to the invitation by the State University System (SUE, for the Spanish original) (Bogotá chapter), I had the opportunity to give a presentation on Crossref during the 2018 International Open Access Week held at Universidad Militar Nueva Granada. Around 50 people participated, including members and non-members of Crossref. There, I emphasized the nature of Crossref as a non-profit organization, based on affiliations and the importance of new members participating in the annual elections organized by Crossref and running to be representatives in the Crossref Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>In November 2018, I had the pleasure of participating in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe_-TawAqQj2QMxKbOmBs4WFHnIAK4iwn\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref Meeting in Toronto</a>, thanks to an invitation from the organizers. There, I talked to the representatives of other organizations who are members of Crossref around the world and I also met some of the members of the Crossref team in person. This event was essential for me as an ambassador, because I learned about Crossref&rsquo;s vision and different projects firsthand, which increased my capacity to explain Crossref&rsquo;s scope and role in the area of scientific communications. I remember that the booth Crossref provided to answer technical questions was particularly useful. There, Isaac, Shayn and other members of the technical team were always available to resolve specific queries that I had not been able to resolve before myself.</p>\n<p>In my second year as an ambassador, I represented Crossref at the Universidad Central del Ecuador (Quito, Ecuador), in a talk with an average of 40 people from different parts of Ecuador. There, I emphasized the technical aspects of the DOI and good practices for its use in academic publications. This talk was held on April 21, 2019, in collaboration with Crossref and <a href=\"http://biteca.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BITECA S.A.S</a>., a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors\">sponsoring member</a> of Crossref.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/arley-biteca-blog.jpg\"\nalt=\"images of Arley Soto presenting\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>In May 2019, with Susan Collins and Vanessa Fairhurst, we organized <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/events\">Crossref LIVE Bogotá</a>, which was not only successful because of the number of attendees from different parts of Colombia and other countries in the region, but also due to the meeting of Latin American ambassadors, where we worked the full morning discussing the priorities and issues of the region with ambassadors from Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru. Apart from other issues, at this meeting, it became clear the need to have better resources and support in Spanish for Spanish-speaking members.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we helped to review the Spanish translation of the &ldquo;You are Crossref&rdquo; booklet, which we printed and distributed at Crossref LIVE Bogotá.</p>\n<p>During 2019, I participated in the <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/introduction-to-crossref-and-content-registration-in-spanish\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Crossref and Content Registration</a> and <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/reference-linking-and-cited-by-in-spanish\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Reference Linking and Cited-by webinar</a> webinars and held the first webinar in Spanish about the new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/member-setup/metadata-manager/\">Metadata Manager</a> tool, always with the ongoing support and assistance of the Crossref team.</p>\n<p>And to end the year with a bang, together with Rachael Lammey, we organized the presentation: Open infrastructure and open data for the global metrics community: what can you build?

Esta relación estrecha con Crossref favoreció para que en 2018 realizáramos el taller de PKP - Crossref entre Juan Pablo Alperín y Susan Collins en el <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200316022408/http://congreso.redalyc.org/ocs/public/congresoEditores/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">3er Congreso Internacional de Editores Redalyc, en la Universidad César Vallejo, ciudad de Trujillo </a></p>\n<p>En ese mismo año, gracias a la invitación realizada por el Sistema Universitario Estatal, SUE (capítulo Bogotá) tuve la oportunidad de hacer una presentación de Crossref en la Semana Internacional de Acceso Abierto 2018, realizado en Universidad Militar Nueva Granada 2018, allí participaron alrededor de 50 personas entre miembros y no miembros de Crossref, aquí hice énfasis en la naturaleza de Crossref como organización sin ánimo de lucro, basada en afiliaciones y la importancia de que los nuevos miembros participen en las votaciones anuales que organiza Crossref y que se postulen para ser representantes en la junta directiva de Crossref.</p>\n<p>En noviembre de 2018 tuve el placer de participar en el <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe_-TawAqQj2QMxKbOmBs4WFHnIAK4iwn\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref Meeting en la ciudad de Toronto</a>, gracias a una invitación de los organizadores. Allí conversé con representantes de  otras organizaciones afiliadas a Crossref alrededor del mundo y también conocí en persona a algunos de los integrantes del equipo de Crossref. Este evento fue de vital importancia para mí como embajador ya que conocí de primera mano la visión y los diferentes proyectos que realiza Crossref, lo que aumentó mi capacidad para explicar en mi contexto el alcance y el papel de Crossref en el entorno de la comunicación científica. Recuerdo que fue particularmente útil el kiosco que dispuso Crossref para atender inquietudes técnicas en donde Isaac, Shane y otros miembros del equipo técnico siempre estuvieron dispuestos a solucionar dudas específicas que no había podido resolver antes por mi mismo.</p>\n<p>En el segundo año como embajador representé a Crossref en la Universidad Central del Ecuador (Quito, Ecuador), charla a la que asistieron en promedio 40 personas de diversos lugares del Ecuador, allí hice énfasis en los aspectos técnicos del DOI y buenas prácticas de su utilización en publicaciones académicas.. Esta charla tuvo lugar el 21 de abril de 2019 y la realizamos en colaboración con Crossref y <a href=\"https://www.biteca.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BITECA SAS</a> miembro <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors\">patrocinador en Crossref</a>.</p>\n<p>En mayo de 2019 organizamos junto con Susan Collins y Vanessa Fairshuit el <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/events\">Crossref LIVE Bogotá</a>, que no solamente fue exitoso por la cantidad de asistentes de diferentes partes de Colombia y de otros países de la región, sino por la reunión de embajadores de Latinoamérica, donde trabajamos una mañana completa para discutir acerca de las prioridades y temáticas propias de la región con embajadores de Brasil, México, Chile y Perú. Entre otros asuntos, en esta reunión se hizo evidente la necesidad de tener mayores recursos y soporte en Español para los miembros hispanohablantes.</p>\n<p>Así mismo contribuimos con la revisión de la traducción al español de la cartilla &ldquo;Usted es Crossref&rdquo; que imprimimos y repartimos durante el Crossref LIVE Bogotá.</p>\n<p>Durante 2019 participé en los webinars <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/introduction-to-crossref-and-content-registration-in-spanish\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Crossref and Content Registration</a> y <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/reference-linking-and-cited-by-in-spanish\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Reference Linking and Cited-by webinar</a> y llevé a cabo el primer Webinar en español sobre la nueva herramienta Metadata Manager, siempre con el acompañamiento y el soporte permanente del equipo de Crossref.</p>\n<p>Y para terminar el año de la mejor manera, preparamos junto con Rachael Lammey la ponencia Open infrastructure and open data for the global metrics community: what can you build? Que presenté en el congreso <a href=\"https://www.latmetrics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">2Latmetrics: métricas alternativas y ciencia abierta en américa latina el 04 de noviembre en la ciudad de Cusco (Perú).</a></p>\n<p>Este recuento de actividades es una muestra del compromiso de los embajadores de Crossref en transmitir el mensaje de la importancia de compartir, citar y hacer visible la ciencia en la web, de una manera ética y responsable.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Introducing our new Director of Finance & Operations","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/introducing-our-new-director-of-finance-operations/","published":"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"I&rsquo;m happy to announce that Lucy Ofiesh has joined Crossref as our new Director of Finance and Operations.

Lucy has experience supporting the sustainability and governance of not-for-profit organizations having held roles such as Executive Vice President of the Brooklyn Children&rsquo;s Museum and for the last few years as Chief Operating Officer at Center for Open Science, a Crossref member.</p>\n<p>At Center for Open Science, Lucy built her knowledge of the research communications community; she is knowledgeable about how diverse this community has become and the challenges of planning and scale that this comes with. She knows how to manage the complexities of an expanding global operation, where members, users––and staff––in several locations need fair, timely, and accurate information, whether it’s about how invoices relate to their use of our services or information about our approach to health benefits.</p>\n<p>Finance underpins all that Crossref does and is crucial to long term sustainability while ‘Operations’ is a varied function and it is only becoming more so as Crossref grows. The role encompasses human resources, organization culture, governance (including serving as secretary of the organization), and working as part of the senior leadership team. Lucy will bring community focus to our operations, putting member experience first so that it becomes easier to work with us, from implementing systems and processes that work for multiple languages and currencies to providing personable billing support.</p>\n<p>She will also play a vital role on the Crossref leadership team, working with me and the other directors Bryan, Ginny, and Geoffrey to hone the strategies, goals, and metrics that will allow us to track progress and meet our ambitious goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-word-from-lucy\">A word from Lucy…</h2>\n<p>I am excited to be joining Crossref as its next Director of Finance and Operations. I previously worked for an organization that was a Crossref member and two qualities stood out to me: first, the focus with which Crossref has provided solutions to shared challenges across scholarly publishing; and second, the ways Crossref operates transparently and from a values-driven perspective.</p>\n<p>My past experience has been in helping organizations run as effectively as they can, navigate change and growth, and build and support high functioning teams. Specifically, my work has focused on strategic and sustainability planning, financial forecasting, organizational governance, and staff management. My goal in finance and operations is to ensure that the working experience at Crossref––both for external partners and members and internal staff––is as frictionless as possible so we can have the greatest impact on our community.</p>\n<p>I am only the second person to step into this role. Lisa Hart Martin has led finance and operations for the first twenty years of Crossref&rsquo;s existence. I am fortunate to be overlapping with her for a couple of weeks and grateful for the trust of the Crossref team to help guide us into our third decade. I really want to hear from our members so please <a href=\"mailto:lofiesh@crossref.org\">reach out to me with your thoughts on Crossref&rsquo;s finance and operations</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Please join us in welcoming Lucy to the Crossref community!</em></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Proposed schema changes - have your say","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/proposed-schema-changes-have-your-say/","published":"Wed, 04 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"The first version of our metadata input schema (a DTD, to be specific) was created in 1999 to capture basic bibliographic information and facilitate matching DOIs to citations.

Over the past 20 years the bibliographic metadata we collect has deepened, and we’ve expanded our schema to include funding information, license, updates, relations, and other metadata. Our schema isn’t as venerable as a MARC record or as comprehensive as JATS, but it’s served us well. It’s not currently positioned to fully support everything we want to do long term - we’d like to support assertions, map cleanly to JATS and schema.org magically at the same time, and maybe even move beyond XML - but for now it’s something we can work with to empower member metadata to help find, cite, and connect scholarly content.</p>\n<p>We’ve maintained backwards compatibility for most things since 2007 but this update will require some moderate changes to how contributors are modeled. The balance between supporting established tagging and addressing the evolution of what we collect and how it is expressed can be tricky. We want to collect good metadata without significantly disrupting the workflow of our membership, who are the source of the metadata. Even so, this is a fairly pragmatic update that will position us well for the future. I look forward to supporting new types of content and metadata in the future, but for now <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCRaWqkne_QqNs0BO78KGfjPFMDkpAQ-ky2nVynkuwc/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">take a look at what I&rsquo;m proposing</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"shortcode-divwrap blue-highlight\">\n<span>Leave feedback, ask questions, and make suggestions in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCRaWqkne_QqNs0BO78KGfjPFMDkpAQ-ky2nVynkuwc/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">feedback document</a> or via email to <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.working\">feedback@crossref.org</a>.</span>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"next-update\">Next update</h2>\n<p>I’m proposing some updates and additions to the metadata we collect, and would like your feedback. To fully and elegantly support affiliation identifiers and multiple author roles, we need to break backwards compatibility. Specifically, we want to:</p>\n<h3 id=\"add-support-for-credit\">Add support for CRediT</h3>\n<p>The CASRAI <a href=\"https://credit.niso.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CRediT taxonomy</a> is increasingly used to represent roles common to contributors to research outputs. Our members are applying CRediT to contributors, so we want to capture them as well. Supporting CRediT allows Crossref and our membership to identify and credit contributors beyond authors and editors.</p>\n<p>As most of you know, a contributor often does more than one thing - they write, they edit, they curate. We currently only allow one contributor role as an attribute, but, to realistically support CRediT and accurately capture evidence about the work, we need to allow multiple contributor roles. This will break backwards compatibility. We can potentially support the old way and the new way, but I’m trying to avoid awkward compromises wherever possible.</p>\n<p>Supporting CRediT doesn’t mean you need to adopt CRediT. We’ll continue to support existing author roles, but they’ll be marked up differently. Details are in our request for feedback document.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expand-support-for-author-and-organization-identifiers\">Expand support for author and organization identifiers</h3>\n<p>We collect ORCID iDs in our metadata but do not currently support other types of contributor identifiers. We also don&rsquo;t support affiliation or organization identifiers beyond those assigned within our funder and clinical trial registries. We’ve had increasing demands from both metadata suppliers and users to expand support for affiliation identifiers because&hellip;identifiers are useful. We also want to expand author identifier support as ORCID IDs may only be registered by researchers who are able to curate their own ORCID record. Adding support for ISNI and Wikidata IDs is a common request, but we anticipate there&rsquo;s a need for other identifiers as well.</p>\n<p>Our plan is to accept identifiers registered with identifiers.org as well as other identifiers upon request. We prefer to remain consistent with the identifiers.org registry as much as possible.</p>\n<p>We’re particularly keen to support open community-led identifiers like ORCID and <a href=\"https://ror.org\" target=\"_blank\">ROR</a> and will continue to do so, but also want to support the metadata our members want to distribute. Organization identifiers will be particularly useful as they’ll help us populate records with ROR IDs in the future, leading to better quality affiliation metadata.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expand-support-for-a-range-of-contributor-names\">Expand support for a range of contributor names</h3>\n<p>We currently require a surname for all contributors, and don’t provide comprehensive support for contributors whose names are represented by multiple alphabets, or who have nicknames or aliases, or who don’t have a surname. To begin with, we’ll replace surname with the more widely used ‘family name’ and remove the fixed surname requirement, allowing only a given name to be provided where appropriate. We’ll also allow a variety of names to be provided for each contributor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expand-affiliation-support\">Expand affiliation support</h3>\n<p>We currently collect affiliation as a single string - we’re going to break that up to support affiliation names, and add in support for organizational identifiers like ROR.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expand-support-for-data-citation\">Expand support for data citation</h3>\n<p>For those of you who send us references, we’re adding a few fields to better support data citation. We’re also going to allow you to (optionally) supply a specific publication type for references.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-updates\">Other updates</h3>\n<p>We’re making some other small updates as well. If you have a small request, we may be able to accommodate it in our next update. Larger changes or additions will probably have to wait for future updates, but we’d love to start collecting suggestions now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-need-your-feedback\">We need your feedback!</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be giving a webinar on December 19 at 02:00 and 15:00 UTC to go over these changes in detail - please <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/webinars/#proposed-schema-changes-have-your-say\">visit our webinars page</a> to register.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, please leave feedback, ask questions, and make suggestions in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCRaWqkne_QqNs0BO78KGfjPFMDkpAQ-ky2nVynkuwc/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">feedback document</a>, or if you prefer send feedback via email to <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.working\">feedback@crossref.org</a>.

Different people have always wanted different things from us and, since our founding, we have brought together diverse organizations to have discussions&mdash;sometimes contentious&mdash;to agree on how to help make scholarly communications better. Being inclusive can mean slow progress, but we’ve been able to advance by being flexible, fair, and forward-thinking.</p>\n<p>We have been helped by the fact that Crossref’s founding organizations defined a clear purpose in our original <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/incorporation-certificate\">certificate of incorporation</a>, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“To promote the development and cooperative use of new and innovative technologies to speed and facilitate scientific and other scholarly research.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Crossref prepares to turn 20 in January 2020, it’s an opportunity to reflect on achievements and highlights from 2018-19 and also ponder the preceding decades. Change is a constant at Crossref but the organization has never strayed from its initial defined purpose. Our services and value now extend well beyond persistent identifiers and reference linking, and our connected open infrastructure benefits our 11,000+ membership as well as all those involved in scholarly research. This expansion is exactly what was envisioned to meet the goal of “speeding and facilitating” research.</p>\n<p>This year&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/y8ygwm5\" target=\"_blank\">annual report</a> is different from previous years’; it has been expanded into a ‘fact file’ so that we can invite comments on the path ahead, based on transparent access to data about our membership, activities, and finances. As we were pulling together the charts and tables for this annual report we noticed stark differences in where Crossref is today compared to years past.</p>\n<p>The rate of membership growth has accelerated and we now have over 180 new members joining every month, leading to one of the most striking changes we found. The lowest three membership tiers now account for 46% of revenue (up from 25% in 2011) while the highest three tiers account for 36% (down from 56% in 2011).\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/revenue-distribution-by-fee-tier-2011-2019.png\"\nalt=\"Revenue distribution by membership fee tier, comparing 2011 with 2019\" width=\"600px\"/>\n</figure>\n<br></p>\n<p>Today, the typical Crossref member has just a few hundred registered content items.\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/percentage-members-by-content-registration-band.png\"\nalt=\"Percentage of members by Content Registration band\" width=\"600px\"/>\n</figure>\n<br>\nOne way we have been able to accommodate this growth efficiently is by collaborating with <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors\">sponsors</a> in different countries. Very small members can join via a local sponsor that is able to provide technical, financial, language, and administrative support. We now have more members joining via sponsors, who otherwise would largely not be able to join at all. While you’d need to be a millionaire by US standards to join directly from Indonesia in our lowest fee tier (calculated using <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Purchasing Power Parity</a>), the sponsor program&mdash;supported often by government investment in science and education&mdash;has enabled Indonesian organizations to join Crossref in large numbers, supporting their aim to become one of the fastest-growing nations in open research, and to help that research be discovered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crossref-has-repeatedly-stayed-ahead-of-developments-in-the-community\">Crossref has repeatedly stayed ahead of developments in the community</h2>\n<p>In 2007, when the Similarity Check working group discussions and pilot started, there was disagreement on the board about whether Crossref should provide such a service and whether it was a strategic priority for members. By the end of the pilot, when the decision came to launch a production service, it was seen as essential and a top priority. This conclusion has been borne out in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RsqtnHssBkaFNphdWoq20_ewruYP04n8j_dYB9wvphM/edit#slide=id.g65af51c04a_1_238\" target=\"_blank\">recent research into the value of Crossref</a>; Similarity Check is one of the services of most importance to members.</p>\n<p>Adding preprints as a content type was controversial at the time. The board discussed the topic of “duplicative works” for about two years with strong opinions on all sides. The working group delivered a good set of policies and technical specifications and in the July 2015 board meeting there was a majority—but not 100%—agreement on the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#july-2015-board-meeting\">motion to approve</a>. We implemented preprints as a content type just in time to accommodate the snowballing of preprint servers emerging from existing and new members.</p>\n<p>Another example of a former&mdash;and current&mdash;area of contention is the approach to metadata. When Crossref first launched, there were lengthy discussions about what metadata we should collect. The initial focus was on the minimal set of metadata to enable reference matching in support of reference linking. In the beginning, neither article titles, lists of authors, references, nor abstracts were included in the minimal metadata set. We supported them as optional but most members opted out. However, the huge set of metadata that Crossref collects and disseminates now is seen as essential, providing a lot of value for members in terms of discoverability.</p>\n<p>Today, Crossref enables metadata retrieval on a large scale—an average of more than 600 million queries per month—through a variety of interfaces, most notably the REST API (Public, Polite, and Plus versions). The metadata is used by thousands of organizations and services—both commercial and not-for-profit—increasing the discoverability of member content. In fact, members of all stripes have long initiated projects to expand the metadata Crossref is able to collect and disseminate: from facilitating text mining (through license and full-text URLs); to enabling better connections with and evidence of contributions (through Funder IDs, ORCID iDs, and soon CRediT roles and ROR IDs).</p>\n<p>These are all examples of where Crossref has successfully “promoted the cooperative use of new and innovative technologies” and where we are meeting our mission to make scholarly communications a little bit better. As ever, we need to thank our brilliant staff for their unfailing resilience, balance, and diligence, in these times of dynamic change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"considering-the-value-and-future-of-crossref\">Considering the value and future of Crossref</h2>\n<p>Research is global, and supporting a diverse global community is a challenge. This year, we conducted our first wide-ranging investigation into what people value from Crossref. This involved telephone interviews with over 40 community members as well as an online survey of 600+ respondents.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RsqtnHssBkaFNphdWoq20_ewruYP04n8j_dYB9wvphM/edit#slide=id.g65af51c04a_1_238\" target=\"_blank\">results of the value research</a> are referenced throughout the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/annual-report\">annual report/fact file</a> and are available online publicly. We will be discussing the insights in various forums and posing some questions, such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How should Crossref balance the different dynamics in the community?</li>\n<li>Are the right members involved in key decisions?</li>\n<li>Are the sustainability model we have and the fees we charge fair?</li>\n<li>Which initiatives should be top or bottom priorities?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Director of MIT Press, Amy Brand, recently reflected that <a href=\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/22/crossref-at-a-crossroads-all-roads-lead-to-crossref/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref is currently at a crossroads</a>, envisioning that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Crossref of 2040 could be an even more robust, inclusive, and innovative consortium to create and sustain core infrastructures for sharing, preserving, and evaluating research information.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But only if Crossref is not:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“held back, and its remit circumscribed, by legacy priorities and forces within the industry that may perceive open data and infrastructure as a threat to their own evolving business interests.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We welcome this public commentary and encourage others in the community to respond and report what value Crossref offers as community-owned infrastructure, and how they’d like to see the organization evolve.</p>\n<p>More than ever, we need to have this discussion with a broad and representative group.

School Science and Mathematics, 83(2), 107-111\n</code></pre><p>This reference is the end result of a process that typically includes: finding the right document, obtaining its metadata, and formatting the metadata using a specific citation style. Sadly, the intermediate reference forms or the details of this process are not preserved in the end result. In general, just by looking at the reference string we cannot be sure which document it originates from, what its metadata is, or which citation style was used.</p>\n<p>Global multi-billion dollar fashion industry proves without a doubt that people care about their fashion style. But why should we care about the citation style used to generate a specific reference? This might seem like an insignificant piece of information, but it can be a powerful clue when we try to solve tasks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reference parsing, i.e., extracting metadata from the reference string. If the style is known, we also know where to expect metadata fields in the string, and it is typically enough to use simple regular expressions instead of complicated (and slow) machine learning-based parsers.</li>\n<li>Discipline/topic classification. Citation styles used in documents correlate with their discipline. As a result, knowing the citation style used in the document could provide a useful clue for a discipline classifier.</li>\n<li>Extracting references from documents. Conforming to a specific style might suggest that the reference string was correctly located within a larger document.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though the style is not directly mentioned in the reference string, the string contains useful clues. Some styles will abbreviate the authors&rsquo; first names, and others won&rsquo;t. Some will place the year in parentheses, others separate it with commas. The presence of such fragments in the reference string can be used as the input for the style classifier.</p>\n<p>I used these clues to build an automatic style classifier. It takes a single reference string on the input and classifies it into one of 17 styles or &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;. You can use it as a <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/styleclass/\" target=\"_blank\">Python library</a> or via <a href=\"http://styleclass.labs.crossref.org/citationstyle\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a>. The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/citation_style_classifier\" target=\"_blank\">source code</a> is also available. If you find this project useful, I would love to hear about it!</p>\n<p>And if you are interested in more details about the classifier and how it was built, read on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"data\">Data</h2>\n<p>The data for the experiments was generated automatically. The training and the test set were generated in the same way but from two different samples. The process was the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5,000 documents were randomly chosen from Crossref collection.</li>\n<li>Each document was formatted into 17 citation styles. This resulted in 85,000 pairs (reference string, citation style).</li>\n<li>Very short reference strings were removed. A short reference string typically results from very incomplete metadata of the document.</li>\n<li>From a number of randomly selected references, I removed fragments like the name of the month. These fragments appear in the automatically generated reference strings because sometimes months are included in the metadata records in Crossref collection. However, they rarely appear in the real-life reference strings, so removing them made the dataset more reliable.</li>\n<li>5,000 strings labelled as &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; were also added. These were generated by randomly swapping the words in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; reference strings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This process resulted in two sets: training set containing 87,808 data points and test set containing 87,625 data points. The training set was used to choose various classification parameters and to train the final model. The test set was used to obtain the final estimation of the classifier&rsquo;s accuracy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"styles\">Styles</h2>\n<p>The classifier was trained on the following 17 citation styles (+ &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>acm-sig-proceedings</li>\n<li>american-chemical-society</li>\n<li>american-chemical-society-with-titles</li>\n<li>american-institute-of-physics</li>\n<li>american-sociological-association</li>\n<li>apa</li>\n<li>bmc-bioinformatics</li>\n<li>chicago-author-date</li>\n<li>elsevier-without-titles</li>\n<li>elsevier-with-titles</li>\n<li>harvard3</li>\n<li>ieee</li>\n<li>iso690-author-date-en</li>\n<li>modern-language-association</li>\n<li>springer-basic-author-date</li>\n<li>springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science</li>\n<li>vancouver</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These 17 styles were chosen to cover a vast majority of references that we see in the real-life data, without including too many variants of very similar styles.</p>\n<p>If you need a different style set, fear not. You can use the library to train your own model based on exactly the styles you need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<p>Our learning algorithm cannot work directly with the raw text on the input. It needs numerical features. In the case of text classification (and reference strings are text), one very common feature representation is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model\" target=\"_blank\">bag-of-words</a>. In the simplest variant, each feature represents a single word, and the value of the feature is binary: 1 if the word is present in the text, 0 otherwise.</p>\n<p>There are many variants of this representation, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The input text typically undergoes normalization before the features are extracted. Depending on the use case, this might include lowercasing, removing punctuation, bringing the words to their canonical form by stemming, etc.</li>\n<li>We do not have to use single words as features. In some use cases, it is beneficial to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram\" target=\"_blank\">n-grams</a>, which correspond to fixed-length sequences of words.</li>\n<li>Instead of binary values, we might want to use some other feature weight schemes, such as the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%e2%80%93idf\" target=\"_blank\">TF-IDF representation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our use case is not a typical case of text classification. We cannot use raw words as features, as words do not carry the information about the citation style. Imagine the same document formatted in different styles –– those reference strings will contain the same words, and the learning algorithm won&rsquo;t be able to distinguish between them.</p>\n<p>As a side note, in some cases, some specific words might be important. For example, if the reference contains the word &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo;, chances are the document is from computer science. If so, then perhaps the citing paper is from computer science as well. And in computer science, some styles are more popular than others. Machine learning algorithms are pretty good at detecting such correlations in the data. In the first version of our classifier, however, we do not take this into account. This keeps things simpler.</p>\n<p>If not words, then what matters in our case? It seems that the information about the style is present in punctuation, capitalization and abbreviations.</p>\n<p>To capture these clues, before extracting the features we first map our reference string into a sequence of &ldquo;word types&rdquo; (or &ldquo;character types&rdquo;). The types are the following: <em>lowercase-word</em>, <em>lowercase-letter</em>, <em>uppercase-word</em>, <em>uppercase-letter</em>, <em>capitalized-word</em>, <em>other-word</em>, <em>year</em>, <em>number</em>, <em>dot</em>, <em>comma</em>, <em>left-parenthesis</em>, <em>right-parenthesis</em>, <em>left-bracket</em>, <em>right-bracket</em>, <em>colon</em>, <em>semicolon</em>, <em>slash</em>, <em>dash</em>, <em>quote</em>, <em>other</em>.</p>\n<p>In addition, we mark the beginning and the end of the reference string with special types <em>start</em> and <em>end</em>.</p>\n<p>So for example this string:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>Eberlein, T. J. Yearbook of Surgery 2006, 322–324.\n</code></pre><p>is mapped into this sequence:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>start capitalized-word comma uppercase-letter dot uppercase-letter dot capitalized-word lowercase-word capitalized-word year comma number dash number dot end\n</code></pre><p>This transformation effectively brings together different words, as long as their form is the same.</p>\n<p>After transforming the reference string we extract 2-grams, 3-grams and 4-grams. The values of the features are TF-IDF weights.</p>\n<p>Some example features in our representation include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>lowercase-word lowercase-word lowercase-word lowercase-word</em> - a sequence of four lowercase words. It is most likely the part of the article title and won&rsquo;t have a huge impact on the decision about the citation style.</li>\n<li><em>capitalized-word comma uppercase-letter dot</em> - typical representation of an author in some styles, where the first name is given as an initial only and follows the last name.</li>\n<li><em>left-parenthesis year right-parenthesis</em> - typical for styles that enclose the year in parentheses.</li>\n<li><em>number dash number</em> - this sequence is most likely pages range.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"learning-algorithm\">Learning algorithm</h2>\n<p>I tested four learning algorithms (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier\" target=\"_blank\">naive Bayes</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression\" target=\"_blank\">logistic regression</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine\" target=\"_blank\">linear support vector classification</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest\" target=\"_blank\">random forest</a>) in a 5-fold cross validation on the training set. The plot shows the distribution of accuracies obtained by each algorithm:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/citation_style_classification_algorithms.png\"\nalt=\"reference forms\" width=\"600px\"/>\n</figure>\n<br/>\n<p>Based on these results, logistic regression was chosen as the algorithm with the best mean accuracy and the lowest variance of the results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-accuracy-estimation\">Final accuracy estimation</h2>\n<p>The final model was trained on the entire training set and evaluated on the test set. As evaluation metric <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision\" target=\"_blank\">accuracy</a> was used. In this case, accuracy is simply the fraction of the references in the test set correctly classified by the classifier.</p>\n<p>The accuracy on the test set was 94.7%. The confusion matrix shows which styles were most often confused with each other:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/citation_style_classification_confusion_matrix.png\"\nalt=\"reference forms\" width=\"800px\"/>\n</figure>\n<br/>\n<p>The most often confused styles are chicago-author-date and american-sociological-association. Let&rsquo;s see some example strings from these two styles:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>Legros, F. 2003. &#34;Can Dispersive Pressure Cause Inverse Grading in Grain Flows?: Reply.&#34; Journal of Sedimentary Research 73(2):335–335\nLegros, F. 2003. &#34;Can Dispersive Pressure Cause Inverse Grading in Grain Flows?: Reply.&#34; Journal of Sedimentary Research 73 (2) : 335–335\n</code></pre><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>Clarke, Jennie T. 2011. &#34;Recognizing and Managing Reticular Erythematous Mucinosis.&#34; Archives of Dermatology 147(6):715\nClarke, Jennie T. 2011. &#34;Recognizing and Managing Reticular Erythematous Mucinosis.&#34; Archives of Dermatology 147 (6) : 715\n</code></pre><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>Chalmers, Alan, and Richard Nicholas. 1983. &#34;Galileo on the Dissipative Effect of a Rotating Earth.&#34; Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 14(4):315–40\nChalmers, Alan, and Richard Nicholas. 1983. &#34;Galileo on the Dissipative Effect of a Rotating Earth.&#34; Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 14 (4) : 315–340\n</code></pre><p>It seems that the styles are indeed very similar. The strings look almost identical, apart from spacing, which is not included in any way in our feature representation. No wonder that the classifier confuses these two styles a lot.</p>\n<p>A more detailed analysis of the classifier can be found <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/citation_style_classifier/blob/master/analyses/citation_style_classification.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Accidental release of internal passwords, & API tokens for the Crossref system","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/accidental-release-of-internal-passwords-api-tokens-for-the-crossref-system/","published":"Fri, 04 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"TL;DR On Wednesday, October 2nd, 2019 we discovered that we had accidentally pushed the main Crossref system as part of a docker image into a developer’s account on Docker Hub.

The binaries and configuration files that made up the docker image included embedded passwords and API tokens that could have been used to compromise our systems and infrastructure. When we discovered this, we immediately secured the repo, changed all the passwords and secrets, and redeployed the system code. We have since been scanning all of our logs and systems to see if there has been any unusual activity that could be related to the exposure of the container.</p>\n<p>Please note that no external data e.g. member passwords or personal information were exposed; our source code contains only internal passwords and ‘secrets’ such as API tokens.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the way in which these secrets were exposed (in compressed, binary files which were, in turn, in a Docker image) means that they were probably overlooked by the automated exploitation tools which focus on scanning source code. And, so far, we have seen nothing that would indicate that these passwords and secrets have been exploited. We will, of course, inform our members directly (and update this blog) if that changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-than-you-probably-want-to-know\">More than you probably want to know</h2>\n<p>If you are continuing to read this, my guess is that you might have questions like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why are you doing something as silly as embedding secrets and passwords in your code?</li>\n<li>And wait a minute… I thought Crossref code was open source?</li>\n<li>And why is the director of strategic initiatives announcing this?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let me answer these questions in random order.</p>\n<p>In March 2019 I took over Crossref’s technical teams when Chuck Koscher announced that he would be retiring at the end of the year. I’m now the director of technology &amp; research.</p>\n<p>A few months earlier we had already concluded that a major portion of the Crossref system had accumulated 20 years of technical debt and that we were going to spend a significant portion of 2019 and 2020 paying down that debt.</p>\n<p>Specifically, a lot of the code that runs Crossref was inherited from a third party who developed it back in the early 2000s. This means that, even though any new systems that we’ve developed since 2007 have been open-source, the code for the oldest parts of the system has remained closed because it contained potentially proprietary code as well as a lot of deprecated coding practices. Also - the architecture, the tooling, and the development processes behind the Crossref system had not changed much in those twenty years. It was fantastic architecture, tooling, and code for its time. But architectures that scale to millions of records need to change to handle hundreds of millions of records. Processes that work for configuring one service need to change when you are managing dozens of services. And support tools that work for a few hundred members break down when you are dealing with tens of thousands of members.</p>\n<p>These parts of the Crossref system were decidedly not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology\" target=\"_blank\">12 factor</a>. We were not using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps\" target=\"_blank\">DevOps</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering\" target=\"_blank\">SRE</a> working practices to run them. And the bulk of that part of the system is still being run in a traditional data center.</p>\n<p>But since March we have been slowly fixing that. In incremental steps. Some of which are visible as a side effect of the security incident that precipitated this blog post. For example, one of our first moves was to move our development to <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref\" target=\"_blank\">Gitlab</a>. Even though a big chunk of the base Crossref code is still closed source, we saw moving to Gitlab as a priority because Gitlab offers a fantastic suite of tools to help automate and manage our deployments. Similarly, we have been Dockerizing the Crossref system so that it is easier to scale and run in different environments. And as part of this effort, we have spent a lot of time on the issue of how to best handle secrets. We knew our secrets management in this part of the codebase was horrible. We have been developing some experiments and infrastructure for handling these secrets securely. But we haven’t finished this work yet. And so the system slipped out into a public repo too early. Ironically, this too illustrates a fundamental change in the way we develop things. <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/truths/\">Our default is to be open and transparent</a>. This case is currently an exception. An exception we want to eliminate, but one we are not ready to do yet. We have to audit and scrub the code first.</p>\n<p>Yes, this incident has been embarrassing. But not nearly as embarrassing as the fact that Crossref has succumbed to a technology industry cliche. That we spent so much time growing and focusing on new features for our members, that we neglected some of the creaking infrastructure of our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>And I should be clear about two things:</p>\n<p>First, not all of our code is like this. We have, for a long time, been building open source software and using modern best practices for secrets management in our newer subsystems and services. The problems described above are confined to twenty-year-old-code that we didn’t write in the first place and that we had been avoiding refactoring.</p>\n<p>And second, the technology team has been marvelous at responding to the challenge we face. They have adopted new processes and tools. They are learning new techniques. We are steadily chipping away at these problems.</p>\n<p>It is generally considered bad practice to praise or reward technology teams for fire-fighting instead of fire prevention, but this may be the exception that proves the rule.</p>\n<p>I was blown away by how the technology, product, and support teams worked together. When we discovered this problem, I sat at my desk in rural France and watched as staff from the UK, and all three US time zones shut down this problem in just a couple of hours. Obviously, I wish we hadn’t had the problem in the first place, but seeing their response did a great deal to encourage me that we are on the right track.</p>\n<p>In any case, it looks like we’ve been lucky. And we’ll be working even harder to refactor our code, tools, and processes so that this kind of thing doesn’t happen again.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Request for feedback: Conference ID implementation","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/request-for-feedback-conference-id-implementation/","published":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"We’ve all been subject to floods of conference invitations, it can be difficult to sort the relevant from the not-relevant or (even worse) sketchy conferences competing for our attention.

In 2017, DataCite and Crossref started a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/conferences-projects/\">working group</a> to investigate creating identifiers for conferences and projects. Identifiers describe and disambiguate, and applying identifiers to conference events will help build clear durable connections between scholarly events and scholarly literature.</p>\n<p>Chaired by Aliaksandr Birukou, the Executive Editor for Computer Science at Springer Nature, the group has met regularly over the past two years, collaborating to create use cases and define metadata to identify and describe conference series and events. We first asked for input on metadata specifications in <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/pids-for-conferences-your-comments-are-welcome/\">April 2018</a>. Technical implementation kicked off in February with a workshop at CERN to discuss the mechanics of making PIDs for conferences a reality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"weve-reached-another-milestone-and-want-your-feedback\">We’ve reached another milestone and want your feedback</h2>\n<p>Crossref has supported a number of conference publication-related PIDs for years - members can currently register PIDs for conference series publications, conference proceedings, and of course individual conference papers - and that won’t change, but we will also be supporting DOI registration for conferences. A crucial step towards this is of course integrating the new identifier into our metadata input schema.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-details\">The details</h2>\n<p>We currently collect some limited metadata describing the conference itself such as theme, location, and dates as part of the conference series or proceeding metadata, but do not apply a DOI to that information. The new Conference ID records will include expanded metadata as <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1URIvkUpzcfjSd2YFIS-rdRIrOyrKSbFfhkdpGPRTAFI/edit\" target=\"_blank\">defined by the working group</a>. You&rsquo;ll be able to register a distinct metadata record for a single conference. You&rsquo;ll also be able to register a record for a conference series, and connect Conference IDs to conference proceeding metadata records and DOIs.</p>\n<p>Changes to the conference-specific metadata are backwards compatible. Members will be able to register event metadata per usual, or can instead use the new event metadata to register an identifier for their conference event and/or series. This means a member can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Register conference, conference series, proceedings series, proceedings, and papers in one submission</li>\n<li>Register proceedings or proceedings series and papers without a Conference ID included</li>\n<li>Register Conference IDs only</li>\n<li>Update an existing conference record with a Conference PID</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ve written up our proposal <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17hKUa2WHxeUpqEe9H0I022Ggod4ID5bmuDDNmvZQn58/edit#\" target=\"_blank\">in this google doc</a> and we want your feedback before we proceed with implementation.

June saw our first ever non-English LIVE local event in Bogota held in collaboration with Biteca, and in an action-packed week in July, Rachael Lammey and myself jetted across to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok where we collaborated with Malaysian Ministry of Education, USIM, Chulalongkorn University, iGroup, and ORCID to run two events for our South-East Asian members.</p>\n<p>Despite the varied locations, speakers and audiences at these events, some common themes emerged&hellip;</p>\n<h2 id=\"language-matters\">Language Matters</h2>\n<p>We currently work with member organisations in over 125 countries around the world, spanning an even greater number of languages. Whilst, at the moment at least, it is not possible to provide support across all these languages, we are improving support for non-native English speakers. We now have service <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO0pjPM4wCJRnjI6ivFXKGA/playlists?view=50&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=2\" target=\"_blank\">videos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/\">factsheets</a>, and brochures available in 8 languages including: French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Bahasa Indonesia. As well as expanding our webinars to include a series in Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Arabic, Spanish and Turkish so far.</p>\n<p>Our global team of 24 <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/ambassadors/\">Ambassadors</a> have been key in helping us to provide translated documentation, to run multi-lingual webinars and in-person events, and to answer questions from our members across languages and timezones. Our LIVE local event in Bogota, saw us run our first ever Spanish event with support from our Latin American ambassador team.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/ambassadors-bogota.jpg\" alt=\"Ambassadors in Bogota\" width=\"500px\" />\n</p>\n<p>I know first hand how daunting public speaking can be, particularly in a second language. As a non-native Spanish speaker, the fear of being misunderstood or mis-pronouncing a word can be paralysing. Members come along to our events with a whole host of questions, sometimes preferring to come and speak to us one-on-one at the break or follow up with us after the event. Everyone has their own preferences, however, being able to communicate in the local language helps to break down barriers and boosts audience participation by taking away these added pressures.</p>\n<p>Additionally after running a number of these events, one of the key things we have learnt is how much content to cover in a day. Our LIVE locals are free to attend and open to the whole community. This however can mean that we have a very varied audience in terms of technical know-how and experience of working with our systems. At first we attempted to cover all we could, addressing as many needs, questions and uses of Crossref metadata that we could. However, creating content to please everyone is often a recipe for disaster and information overload. If you start to see your attendee’s eyes glaze over or they start answering emails on their smartphones, you’ve lost them.</p>\n<p>Instead we are now going to tailor our events a little more, asking registrants questions in advance, and selecting specific topics to cover. Having a good range of distinct topics and presenters, including local guest speakers, also helps to maintain momentum and avoid audience fatigue. Wider information and conversations will then continue on our <a href=\"https://community.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Community Forum</a> as well as events being supplemented by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/webinars/\">webinars in local languages and timezones</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"relationship-status-its-complicated\">Relationship status: It’s complicated</h2>\n<p>A question we are often asked when talking to members is how to link distinct content items in the metadata - whether this be a data-set to the published results, a preprint with the version of record, or a translated version of an article with the original.\nLinking these related research outputs is extremely important; researchers need to be able to cite the correct version of the work they have used in their research. Creating a network of these linkages between scholarly outputs also helps ourselves, our members, and the wider community better track how research is used and developed.</p>\n<p>English is by far the most common language used in international academic journals and often is required for publication, however the article can be published in two or more languages, enabling greater discovery and use of the research. A frequent question we get asked is how to register the two versions, whether they use the same DOI or whether each should be assigned its own identifier. Our <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214357426-Relationships-between-DOIs-and-other-objects\" target=\"_blank\">advice</a> is that each version of the article should have it’s own DOI for citation reasons, but should be linked in the metadata of the translated version as in the xml example below:</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/relationship-example-xml.png\" alt=\"Relationship example xml\" width=\"600px\" />\n</p>\n<p>However, our schema covers far more relationship types than purely translations. Another interesting area of discussion which has become increasingly prevalent in the last couple of years is around preprints. We began supporting the registration of preprints in November 2016, using their specific content type and enabling linking in the metadata to the version of record, providing a clear publication history for accurate citation. Today we have almost 150k registered in our system.</p>\n<p>In Kyiv, we had a request to talk more about data citation; the importance of making data available and persistently linked to. Although data is often shared, it is not routinely referenced in the same way as journal articles or other publications, and this is something we want to encourage. When data is cited it provides clarity and context about the research underpinning the published article, as well as enabling greater discovery and re-use of that data in future research and publications. You can do this in two ways at Crossref, either by including data citations your reference lists, or, again, by using the relations section of the schema. If you want to learn more about the ‘how’ of data citation, we have some <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/data-citation-what-and-how-for-publishers\">useful guidance</a> you can take a look at.</p>\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/Otters.png\" alt=“Meaningful connections like the otters\" height=\"100px\" width=\"300px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/Otters.png\" alt=“Meaningful connections like the otters\" height=\"100px\" width=\"300px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<p>As we are always saying Crossref is all about making connections. Linking research objects by capturing and declaring relationships within your metadata helps to map the evolution of research. Making the distinct parts of the research and publication process accessible by both readers and machines, enables wider discovery, re-use, transparency, accuracy of citations and provides greater acknowledgment of contributors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finding-solutions-to-resolutions\">Finding Solutions to Resolutions</h2>\n<p>Reports are rarely the things that get pulses racing (you should probably take a long, hard look at yourself if so) but they are important and can be very useful to make sure your content and the associated metadata is being registered correctly.</p>\n<p>We often get questions from members who want to better understand their resolution reports. These are reports generated on a monthly basis for each DOI prefix, sent to the business contact for your organization, which provide statistics on the resolution rates of your content. So what do we mean by a resolution? Well simply, when a reader clicks on a DOI link for an article, that counts as one DOI resolution. No information is captured about the user or where they are coming from. Although we work to filter out computer-generated usage, the numbers are not a precise measure of human click-throughs to a publishers website - cached articles, search engine crawlers, and traffic directed through a library link resolver can be included in these numbers. However, the reports still provide a good idea of traffic to your publications via the DOI.</p>\n<p>Often the part of the report which is of particular interest is the resolution failure rate. Although in an ideal world this would be 0%, realistically 2-3% is the norm. Publishers who are new to Crossref or who have created a small number of DOIs may have a higher failure percentage and this isn’t necessarily a problem (for example, a publisher with 1 failure and 9 successes will have a 10% failure rate). A .csv file containing a list of all failed DOI resolution attempts for the month is attached to each report so that you can review any significant number of failures or any dramatic changes which may indicate a problem that needs to be solved.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible reasons for DOI failures:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bad links - check that your DOI is directing readers to the correct location of your full text or landing page.</li>\n<li>Undeposited DOIs - any DOIs that have been distributed or published should be deposited immediately. Simply adding a DOI to your content page will not automatically register this link.</li>\n<li>Similarly, if your DOI was deposited mid-month and distributed earlier, any attempts prior to this date will appear as failures on your report.</li>\n<li>User error - sometimes users can make mistakes when typing or copy-and-pasting DOIs. To minimize the risk of this keep your DOIs simple and short.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also important to make sure you keep the contact details we have on file for your organization up to date.

The board of directors, comprising 16 member organizations, governs Crossref, sets its strategic direction and makes sure that we fulfill our mission. Our members elect the board - its &ldquo;one member one vote&rdquo; - and we like to see as many members as possible voting. We are very pleased to announce the 2019 election slate - we have a great set of candidates and an update to the ByLaws addressing the composition of the slate to ensure that the board continues to be representative of our membership.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2019-election-slate\">2019 Election Slate</h2>\n<p>Crossref received 52 expressions of interest this year through the link that was sent out via our blog, and over 100 emails from members interested in serving on our Board. It is very exciting to see that our members want to be involved.</p>\n<p>In March of this year, the Board made a motion per the recommendation of an adhoc Governance Committee. It was resolves to &ldquo;provide the following guidance to the Nominating Committee: To achieve balance between revenue tiers by proposing a 2019 slate consisting of one Revenue Tier 1 seat and four Revenue tier 2 seats, and a 2020 slate consisting of four Revenue Tier 1 seats and two Revenue Tier 2 seats; thereby resulting in, as nearly as practicable, an equal balance between board members representing Revenue Tier 1 and Revenue Tier 2 (as those terms are defined in Crossref&rsquo;s ByLaws below).&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>Section 2.</em>     Nominating Committee. The Board shall appoint a Nominating Committee of five (5) members, each of whom shall be either a Director or the designated representative of a member that is not represented on the Board, whose duty it shall be to nominate candidates for Directors to be elected at the next annual election. The Nominating Committee shall designate a slate of candidates for each election that is at least equal in number to the number of Directors to be elected at such election. Each such slate will be comprised such that, as nearly as practicable, one-half of the resulting Board shall be comprised of Directors designated by Members then representing Revenue Tier 1; and one-half of the resulting Board shall be comprised of Directors designated by Members then representing Revenue Tier 2.  &ldquo;Revenue Tier 1&rdquo; means all consecutive membership dues categories, starting with the lowest dues category, that, when taken together, aggregate, as nearly as possible, to fifty percent (50%) of Crossref&rsquo;s annual revenue. &ldquo;Revenue Tier 2&rdquo; means all membership dues categories above Revenue Tier 1. The Nominating Committee shall notify the Secretary in writing, at least twenty (20) days before the date of the annual meeting, of the names of such candidates, and the Secretary, except as herein otherwise provided, shall transmit a copy thereof to the last recorded address of each member of record simultaneously with the notice of the meeting.</p>\n<p>The Committee and the Board has worked very hard to balance the Board, so you will see two categories on the ballot, large and small.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-2019-slate-includes-seven-candidates-for-five-available-seats\">The 2019 slate includes: seven candidates for five available seats</h2>\n<p>Candidate organizations, in alphabetical order, for the Small category (1 seat available):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>eLife</strong>, Melissa Harrison</li>\n<li><strong>The Royal Society</strong>, Stuart Taylor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Candidate organizations, in alphabetical order, for the Large category (4 seats available):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clarivate Analytics</strong>, Nandita Quaderi</li>\n<li><strong>Elsevier</strong>, Chris Shillum</li>\n<li><strong>IOP</strong>, Graham McCann</li>\n<li><strong>Springer Nature</strong>, Reshma Shaikh</li>\n<li><strong>Wiley</strong>, Todd Toler</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"shortcode-divwrap blue-highlight\">\n<span><h3 id=\"take-a-look-at-the-candidates-organizational-and-personal-statementsboard-and-governanceelections2019-slate\"><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/elections/2019-slate/\">Take a look at the candidates&rsquo; organizational and personal statements</a></h3>\n</span>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"you-can-be-part-of-this-important-process-by-voting-in-the-election\">You can be part of this important process, by voting in the election</h2>\n<p>If your organization is a voting member in good standing of Crossref as of September 13, 2019, you are eligible to vote when voting opens on September 27, 2019.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-you-vote\">How can you vote?</h2>\n<p>On September 27, 2019, your organization&rsquo;s designated voting contact will receive an email with the Formal Notice of Meeting and Proxy Form with concise instructions on how to vote.  You will also receive a user name and password with a link to our voting platform.</p>\n<p>The election results will be announced at <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual/\">LIVE19 Amsterdam</a> on November 13, 2019.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Building better metadata with schema releases","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/building-better-metadata-with-schema-releases/","published":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"This month we have officially released a new version of our input metadata schema.

As well as walking through the latest additions, I&rsquo;ll also describe here how we&rsquo;re starting to develop a new streamlined and open approach to schema development, using GitLab and some of the ideas under discussion going forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-included-in-version-442\">What&rsquo;s included in version 4.4.2</h2>\n<p>The latest schema as of August 2019 is version 4.4.2 and this release now includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/help/pending-publication/\">pending publication</a>&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Support for JATS 1.2 abstracts</li>\n<li>Abstract support to dissertations, reports, and allow multiple abstracts wherever available</li>\n<li>Support for multiple dissertation authors</li>\n<li>A new <code>acceptance_date</code> element added to journal article, book, book chapter, and conference paper content types</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&ldquo;Pending publication&rdquo; is the term we&rsquo;ve coined for the phase where a manuscript has been accepted for publication but where the publisher needs to communicate a DOI much earlier than most article metadata is available. Some members asked for the ability to register and assign DOIs prior to online publication, even without a title, so this allows members to register a DOI with minimal metadata, temporarily, before online publication. There is of course no obligation to use this feature.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth calling out the addition of <code>acceptance_date</code> too. This is a key attribute that is heavily requested by downstream metadata users like universities. Acceptance dates allow people to report on outputs much more accurately, so we do encourage all members to start including acceptance dates in their metadata. It&rsquo;s highly appreciated!</p>\n<h2 id=\"schema-files-public-on-gitlab\">Schema files public on GitLab</h2>\n<p>I’ve added our latest schema to a new <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/schema\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab repository</a>, There you’ll find the schema files, some documentation, and the opportunity to suggest enhancements. The schema has been released as bundle <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/crossref/schema/-/releases\" target=\"_blank\">0.1.1</a> and also includes our new Grant metadata schema for members that fund research.</p>\n<p>The schema has been available in some form for months but at this point we consider it ‘officially’ released to kick off our new but necessary practice of formal schema releases. Any forthcoming updates will be added to the next version.</p>\n<h2 id=\"schema-management-process\">Schema management process</h2>\n<p>We’ve been adding sets of metadata and new content types over the years, but also need to have a defined process for small but vital pieces of metadata that you need to provide and retrieve from our metadata records. If you’re wondering what our procedure for updating our schema is, you are not alone! We have not had a formal process, instead relying on ad-hoc requests from our membership and working groups. Our release management and schema numbering has also not been consistent.</p>\n<p>Going forward, I will ensure that all forthcoming versions of our metadata schema are be posted as a draft on GitLab for review and comment, and the final version will be officially released via GitLab as well.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that when we talk about &ldquo;the schema&rdquo;, we generally mean the <em>input</em> schema specifically i.e. what members of Crossref can register about the content they produce. As always, the output for retrieving that metadata is subject to separate development plans for our Metadata APIs. I&rsquo;m working with our technical team so we can develop and introduce an &rsquo;end-to-end&rsquo; approach that doesn&rsquo;t in future treat the input and the output as such separate considerations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&rsquo;s next</h2>\n<p>Many of the updates in this latest release have been in the works for some time. Changes to our metadata both large and small are considered carefully, but I’d like to do this in a transparent and cooperative way with our community.</p>\n<p>I recently set up the &ldquo;Metadata Practitioners Interest Group&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ve just had our second call. A big topic was how to best manage the ideas and requests from the community. The ability for public comments on GitLab is a first step.</p>\n<p>This most recent update contains a mix of long term projects and updates to keep our metadata current and useful. Other changes that are under discussion will require more development on our end. But stay tuned for more information about forthcoming changes, as well information about how you can contribute.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Introducing our new Director of Product","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/introducing-our-new-director-of-product/","published":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"I&rsquo;m happy to announce that Bryan Vickery has joined Crossref today as our new Director of Product.

In 2017, according to statistics from <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UNESCO</a>, <a href=\"http://uis.unesco.org/apps/visualisations/research-and-development-spending/\" target=\"_blank\">$1.7 trillion dollars</a> were invested globally in Research and Development. A lot of this money comes from the public - <a href=\"http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SCN_DS&amp;lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">22c in every dollar </a>spent on R&amp;D in the USA comes from government funds, for example. Funders really do support a LOT of research.</p>\n<p>For that research to count, it needs to be communicated. For us to interpret those research communications critically, we need to understand how the research was done and <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/disguising-corporate-influence-science-about-sugar-and-health\" target=\"_blank\">who paid</a> for it.</p>\n<p>At Crossref, we’ve been <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/funders\">working with funders</a> for many years. The <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\">Open Funder Registry</a> was launched (with donated support from Elsevier) in 2012, and provides a taxonomy of funders, each uniquely identified, which has grown to cover 20,000 funders around the world. This resource has helped to connect the organizations that provide research funds to resources, projects, and publications. Some are also members and have been registering content with us. This is a growing trend as more funders start to launch their own <a href=\"https://amrcopenresearch.org/\" target=\"_blank\">open platforms</a>. Funders also consume metadata from Crossref members, using it to track and report on the published outputs of the researchers they support.</p>\n<p>More recently, we have been exploring the ways that we can do more in partnership with the funding community. As our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/\">board</a> concluded in 2017,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Crossref requires increased emphasis on funders, understanding their needs and requirements and increasingly including funders in the scholarly communication dialogue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In response, we have explored new services and practical enhancements to our existing portfolio, such as the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/content-types-intro/grants/\">new grants registration system</a>, which will also power search and lookup tools.</p>\n<p>This new initiative will link <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/grantID-schema\" target=\"_blank\">structured information about grants</a> with DOIs, and enable us to provide open tools to help institutions, publishers, and research supporting organizations to re-use that data and make long-lasting connections between specific funding (and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/global-persistent-identifiers-for-grants-awards-and-facilities/\">other kinds of research support</a>) and research activities and outcomes. The value of this was beautifully explained by our friends at <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Wellcome</a> (now members) in this <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/wellcome-explains-the-benefits-of-developing-an-open-and-global-grant-identifier/\">blog post</a>, and was reinforced by a recent survey undertaken by ORCID in which linking grants to outputs was cited as one of the major challenges facing funders. The Grant IDs project launched this July with a group of early adopter funders, ably supported by the team at <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Europe PMC</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re not stopping there though: we are lucky to have a dedicated and engaged <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders\">funder advisory group</a>, and we will continue to work with them to understand how our interactions with funders can benefit the wider ecosystem that we support, and help funders to achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>There are many platforms providing vital intelligence to funders, from <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Dimensions</a> to <a href=\"https://www.openaire.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAIRE</a>, which rely on Crossref data. Last month, I was at the <a href=\"https://indico.cern.ch/event/786048/\" target=\"_blank\">OAI11 workshop</a> in <a href=\"https://www.geneve.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Geneva</a>, and it was striking how many presentations included a slide that mentioned using Crossref data. There were 200 people from the open science community there, and they clearly rely on Crossref as a <a href=\"https://cameronneylon.net/blog/where-are-the-pipes-building-foundational-infrastructures-for-future-services/\" target=\"_blank\">foundational infrastructure</a> to build their ecosystem. That community is also just a subset of the more than 2,500 registered consumers of Crossref metadata. We need to keep asking how this metadata can improve the information available to funders, to their partners and to service providers. Adding grants to the mix will help all of these parties provide an even richer picture of research.</p>\n<p>As we move forward with our engagement with the global funding community, new opportunities are becoming visible, and not just for funders. Better experiences for authors, reduced overhead for publishers and easier benchmarking for institutions are a selection of benefits that this work can help us realize.</p>\n<p>When we really start to get to grips with opening up information about the inputs to research in the way we already have with its outputs, truly exciting things can happen. The really great thing about this is that, quite literally, everyone benefits: from Crossref members to everyone touched by advances in our understanding of the world.

It addresses a similar problem to the one that led to the creation of <a href=\"http://orcid.org\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID</a>: researchers&rsquo; names are hard to disambiguate and are rarely unique; they get abbreviated, have spelling variations and change over time.</p>\n<p>The same is true of organizations. You don’t have to read all that many papers to see authors acknowledge funding from the US National Institutes of Health as NIH, National Institutes for Health, National Institute of Health, etc. And wait, are you sure they didn’t mean National Institute for Health Research? (An entirely separate UK-based funder).</p>\n<p>And a lot of countries have a National Science Foundation…</p>\n<p>If each funder has a unique identifier, our members can <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/funder-registry/\">include it in the metadata</a> that they register with us, giving a clear and accurate link between the funder of the research and the published outcomes. And we can make that information available to everyone via our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/\">API</a>, and build <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org/funding\" target=\"_blank\">human interfaces</a> so that you can look it up.</p>\n<p>Many types of funding bodies are represented in the Funder Registry, from government agencies and large international foundations to small single-mission charities, and everything in between. As well as a unique DOI for each institution, the Registry contains additional metadata that can help to identify the funder such as country, abbreviated or alternate names, translated names, and so on.</p>\n<p>The Registry also supports relationships between different funders. These can be hierarchical parent/child relationships for larger organizations, or connections between archival and current entries in instances where a funder has changed its name or become part of another body (to tell us about these kinds of changes you just need to <a href=\"mailto:funder.registry@crossref.org\">get in touch</a>).</p>\n<p>The Registry was donated to Crossref by Elsevier when we first introduced funding information as part of our Content Registration schema back in 2012. We started out with a list of just over 4000 funders. Through an ongoing partnership the list has been - and continues to be - updated on a monthly basis by Elsevier, and sent to Crossref as a formatted XML file that we process and release.</p>\n<p>In return, Crossref sends Elsevier a feed of funder names that our members have registered with us that are not present in the Registry, which a team at Elsevier validates and adds to their databases, and then puts those newly-identified funders in to the next iteration of the list they send to us. It’s nice and circular and benefits both parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"we-released-v127-of-the-funder-registryhttpsgithubcomcrossrefopen-funder-registry-last-week-and-it-contains-entries-for-an-impressive--21356-funders\">We released <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/open-funder-registry\" target=\"_blank\">v1.27 of the Funder Registry</a> last week, and it contains entries for an impressive 21,356 funders.</h3>\n<p>I’ve been involved in this project since its inception, and have enjoyed a productive and cooperative working relationship with the team at Elsevier, headed by Peter Berkvens (Senior Product Manager) and Paul Mostert (Director Product Management). I asked them to explain a little about the process from their side:</p>\n<p>“Our team maintains a workflow in which Acknowledgement and Funding sections from articles are scanned for appearances of funding organizations using Natural Language Processing techniques. External Elsevier vendors then edit the data and add the validated names of the funders to what is called the Funding Bodies Taxonomy. The latter feeds Crossref’s Open Funder Registry.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Taxonomy is nearing 22,000 Funders. It is expected it will grow to 25,000 Funders eventually. When this stage is reached, Elsevier believes that all existing Funders will be covered in the Funder Registry. Elsevier will continue to maintain the list adding new Funders as soon as they appear in scientific papers.</p>\n<p>Elsevier’s Primary Articles production workflow for ScienceDirect uses the Funder Registry during the copyediting process, validating and tagging the Funders that appear in the accepted articles for Elsevier journals hosted by ScienceDirect. We then send the funder names and IDs to Crossref as part of our metadata.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone involved for getting us ever-closer to a truly comprehensive list of funders.</p>\n<p>And if you’re a member who’s not already registering funding information, why not look into <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/funder-registry/\">getting started?</a> It all leads to richer metadata which means more people can find, cite and re-use research &ndash; and we all know that’s a <a href=\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/06/11/better-metadata-could-help-save-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">good thing</a>&hellip;</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"What if I told you that bibliographic references can be structured?","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/what-if-i-told-you-that-bibliographic-references-can-be-structured/","published":"Mon, 08 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Last year I spent several weeks studying how to automatically match unstructured references to DOIs (you can read about these experiments in my previous blog posts).

But what about references that are not in the form of an unstructured string, but rather a structured collection of metadata fields? Are we matching them, and how? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>43% of open/limited references deposited with Crossref have no publisher-asserted DOI and no unstructured string. This means they need a matching approach suitable for structured references. <em>[EDIT 6th June 2022 - all references are now open by default].</em></li>\n<li>I adapted our new matching algorithms: Search-Based Matching (SBM) and Search-Based Matching with Validation (SMBV) to work with both structured and unstructured references.</li>\n<li>I compared three matching algorithms: Crossref&rsquo;s current (legacy) algorithm, SBM and SBMV, using a dataset of 2,000 structured references randomly chosen from Crossref&rsquo;s references.</li>\n<li>SBMV and the legacy algorithm performed almost the same. SBMV&rsquo;s F1 was slightly better (0.9660 vs. 0.9593).</li>\n<li>Similarly as in the case of unstructured references, SBMV achieved slightly lower precision and better recall than the legacy algorithm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Those of you who often read scientific papers are probably used to bibliographic references in the form of unstructured strings, as they appear in the bibliography, for example:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[5] Elizabeth Lundberg, “Humanism on Gallifrey,” Science Fiction Studies, vol. 40, no. 2, p. 382, 2013.\n</code></pre><p>This form, however, is not the only way we can store the information about the referenced paper. An alternative is a structured, more machine-readable form, for example using BibTeX format:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>@article{Elizabeth_Lundberg_2013,\nyear = 2013,\npublisher = {{SF}-{TH}, Inc.},\nvolume = {40},\nnumber = {2},\npages = {382},\nauthor = {Elizabeth Lundberg},\ntitle = {Humanism on Gallifrey},\njournal = {Science Fiction Studies}\n}\n</code></pre><p>Probably the most concise way to provide the information about the referenced document is to use its identifier, for example (🥁drum roll&hellip;) the DOI:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>&lt;https://doi.org/10.5621/sciefictstud.40.2.0382&gt;\n</code></pre><p>It is important to understand that these three representations (DOI, structured reference and unstructured reference) are not equivalent. The amount of information they carry varies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The DOI, by definition, provides the full information about the referenced document, because it identifies it without a doubt. Even though the metadata and content are not directly present in the DOI string, they can be easily and deterministically accessed. It is by far the preferred representation of the referenced document.</li>\n<li>The structured reference contains the metadata of the referenced object, but it doesn&rsquo;t identify the referenced object without a doubt. In our example, we know that the paper was published in 2013 by Elizabeth Lundberg, but we might not know exactly which paper it is, especially if there are more than one document with the same or similar metadata.</li>\n<li>The unstructured reference contains the metadata field values, but without the names of the fields. This also doesn&rsquo;t identify the referenced document, and even its metadata is not known without a doubt. In our example, we know that the word “Science” appears somewhere in the metadata, but we don&rsquo;t know for sure whether it is a part of the title, journal title, or maybe the author&rsquo;s (very cool) name.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagram presents the relationships between all these three forms:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/structured_matching_reference_forms.png\"\nalt=\"reference forms\" width=\"800px\"/>\n</figure>\n<br/>\n<p>The arrows show actions that Crossref has to perform to transform one form to another.</p>\n<p>Green transformations are in general easy and can be done without introducing any errors. The reason is that green arrows go from more information to less information. We all know how easy it is to forget important stuff!</p>\n<p>Green transformations are typically performed when the publication is being created. At the beginning the author can access the DOI of the referenced document, because they know exactly which document it is. Then, they can extract the bibliographic metadata (the structured form) of the document based on the DOI, for example by following the DOI to the document&rsquo;s webpage or retrieving the metadata from <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref&rsquo;s REST API</a>. Finally, the structured form can be formatted into an unstructured string using, for example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiteProc\" target=\"_blank\">CiteProc</a> tool.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve also automated it further and these two green transformation (getting the document&rsquo;s metadata based on the DOI and formatting it into a string) can be done in one go using <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/labs/citation-formatting-service/\">Crossref&rsquo;s content negotiation</a>.</p>\n<p>Red transformations are often done in systems that store bibliographic metadata (like our own metadata collection), often at a large scale. In these systems, we typically want to have DOIs (or other unique identifiers) of the referenced documents, but in practise we often have only structured and/or unstructured form. To fix this, we match references. Some systems also perform reference parsing (thankfully, we discovered <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/labs/resolving-citations-we-dont-need-no-stinkin-parser/\">we do not need to do this in our case</a>).</p>\n<p>In general, red transformations are difficult, because we have to go from less information to more information, effectively recreating the information that has been lost during paper writing. This requires a bit of reasoning, educated guessing, and juggling probabilities. Data errors, noise, and sparsity make the situation even more dire. As a result, we do not expect any matching or parsing algorithm to be always correct. Instead, we perform evaluations (like in this blog post) to capture how well they perform on average.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/reference-matching-for-real-this-time/\">previous blog post</a> focused on matching unstructured references to DOIs (long red &ldquo;matching&rdquo; arrow). In this one, I analyse how well we can match structured references to DOIs (short red &ldquo;matching&rdquo; arrow).</p>\n<h2 id=\"references-in-crossref\">References in Crossref</h2>\n<p>You might be asking yourself how important it is to have the matching algorithm working for both structured and unstructured references. Let&rsquo;s look more closely at the references our matching algorithm has to deal with.</p>\n<p>29% of open/limited references deposited with Crossref already have the DOI provided by the publisher member. At Crossref, when we come across those references, we start dancing on a rainbow to the tunes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park\" target=\"_blank\">Linkin Park</a>, while the references holding their DOIs sprinkle from the sky. Some of us sing along. We live for those moments, so if you care about us, please provide as many DOIs in your references as possible!</p>\n<p>You might be wondering how we are sure these publisher-provided DOIs are correct. The short answer is that we are not. After all, the publisher might have used an automated matcher to insert the DOIs before depositing the metadata. Nevertheless, our current workflow assumes these publisher-provided DOIs are correct and we simply accept them as they are.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the remaining 71% of references are deposited without a DOI. Those are the references we try to match ourselves.</p>\n<p>Here is the distribution of all the open/limited references:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/structured_matching_reference_distribution.png\"\nalt=\"reference distibution\" width=\"600px\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>17% of the references are deposited with no DOI and both structured and unstructured form. 11% have no DOI and only an unstructured form, and 43% have no DOI and only a structured form. These 43% cannot be directly processed by the unstructured matching algorithm.</p>\n<p>This distribution clearly shows that we need a matching algorithm able to process both structured and unstructured references. If our algorithm worked only with one type, we would miss a large percentage of the input references, and the quality of our citation metadata would be questionable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-analysis\">The analysis</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the point. I evaluated and compared three matching algorithms, focusing on the structured references.</p>\n<p>The first algorithm is one of the legacy algorithms currently used in Crossref. It uses fuzzy querying in a relational database to find the best matching DOI for the given structured reference. It can be accessed through a <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214880143-OpenURL%23openurl2\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref OpenURL</a> query.</p>\n<p>The second algorithm is an adaptation of the Search-Based Matching (SBM) algorithm for structured references. In this algorithm, we concatenate all metadata fields of the reference and use it to search in the Crossref&rsquo;s REST API. The first hit is returned as the target DOI if its relevance score exceeds the predefined threshold.</p>\n<p>The third algorithm is an adaptation of the Search-Based Matching with Validation (SBMV) for structured references. Similarly as in the case of SBM, we also concatenate all metadata fields of the input reference and use it to search in the <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref&rsquo;s REST API</a>. Next, a number of top hits are considered as candidates and their similarity score with the input reference is calculated. The candidate with the highest similarity score is returned as the target DOI if its score exceeds the predefined threshold. The similarity score is based on fuzzy comparison of the metadata field values between the candidate and the input reference.</p>\n<p>I compared these three algorithms on a test set composed of 2,000 structured bibliographic references randomly chosen from Crossref&rsquo;s metadata. For each reference, I manually checked the output of all matching algorithms, and in some cases performed additional manual searching. This resulted in the true target DOI (or null) assigned to each reference.</p>\n<p>The metrics are the same as in the previous evaluations: precision, recall and F1 calculated over the set of input references.</p>\n<p>The thresholds for SBM and SBMV algorithms were chosen on a separate validation dataset. The validation dataset also contains 2,000 structured references with manually-verified target DOIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-results\">The results</h2>\n<p>The plot shows the results of the evaluation of all three algorithms:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/structured_matching_results.png\"\nalt=\"structured matching evaluation results\" width=\"600px\"/>\n</figure>\n<br/>\n<p>The vertical black lines on top of the bars represent the confidence intervals.</p>\n<p>As we can see, SBMV and the legacy approach achieved very similar results. SBMV slightly outperforms the legacy approach in F1: 0.9660 vs. 0.9593.</p>\n<p>SBMV is slightly worse that the legacy approach in precision (0.9831 vs. 0.9929) and better in recall (0.9495 vs. 0.9280).</p>\n<p>The SBM algorithm performs the worst, especially in precision. Why is there such a huge difference between SBM and SBMV? The algorithms differ in the post-processing validation stage. SBM relies on the ability of the search engine to select the best target DOI, while SBMV re-scores a number of candidates obtained from the search engine using custom similarity. The results here suggest that in the case of structured references, the right target DOI is usually somewhere close to the top of the search results, but often it is not in the first position. One of the reasons might be missing titles in 76% of the structured references, which can confuse the search engine.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look more closely at a few interesting cases in our test set:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>first-page = 1000\narticle-title = Sequence capture using PCR-generated probes: a cost-effective method of targeted high-throughput sequencing for nonmodel organisms\nvolume = 14\nauthor = Peñalba\nyear = 2014\njournal-title = Molecular Ecology Resources\n</code></pre><p>The reference above was successfully matched by SBMV to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12249\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12249</a>, even though the document&rsquo;s volume and pages are missing from Crossref&rsquo;s metadata.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>issue = 2\nfirst-page = 101\nvolume = 6\nauthor = Abraham\nyear = 1987\njournal-title = Promoter: An Automated Promotion Evaluation System\n</code></pre><p>Here the structure incorrectly labels article title as journal title. Despite this, the reference was correctly matched by our brave SBMV to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.6.2.101\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.6.2.101</a>.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>author = Marshall Day C.\nvolume = 39\nfirst-page = 572\nyear = 1949\njournal-title = India. J. A. D. A.\n</code></pre><p>Above we have most likely a parsing error. A part of the article title appears in the journal name, and the main journal name is abbreviated. ‘I see what you did there, my old friend Parsing Algorithm! Only a minor obstacle!&rsquo; said SBMV, and matched the reference to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14219/jada.archive.1949.0114\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.14219/jada.archive.1949.0114</a>.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>volume = 5\nyear = 2015\narticle-title = A retrospective analysis of the effect of discussion in teleconference and face-to-face scientific peer-review panels\njournal-title = BMJ Open\n</code></pre><p>Here the the page number and author are not in the structure, but our invincible SBMV jumped over the holes left by the missing metadata and gracefully grabbed the right DOI <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009138\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009138</a>.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>issue = 2\nfirst-page = 533\nvolume = 30\nauthor = Uthman BM\nyear = 1989\njournal-title = Epilepsia\n</code></pre><p>In this case we have a mismatch in the page number (“533” vs. “S33”). But did SBMV give up and burst into tears? I think we already know the answer! Of course, it conquered the nasty typo with the sword made of fuzzy comparisons (yes, it&rsquo;s a thing!) and brought us back the correct DOI <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1989.tb05823.x\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1989.tb05823.x</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"structured-vs-unstructured\">Structured vs. unstructured</h2>\n<p>How does matching structured references compare to matching unstructured references?</p>\n<p>The general trends are the same. For both structured and unstructured references, SBMV outperforms the legacy approach in F1, achieving worse precision and better recall. This tells us that our legacy algorithms are more strict and as a result they miss some links.</p>\n<p>Structured reference matching seems easier than unstructured reference matching. The reason is that when we have the structure, we can compare the input reference to the candidate field by field, which is more precise than using the unstructured string.</p>\n<p>Structured matching, however, in practise brings new challenges. One big problem is data sparsity. 15% of structured references without DOIs have fewer than four metadata fields. This is not always enough to identify the DOI. Also, 76% of the structured references without DOIs do not contain the article title, which poses a problem for candidate selection using the search engine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>\n<p>So far, I have focused on evaluating SBMV for unstructured and structured references separately. 17% of the open/limited references at Crossref, however, have both unstructured and structured form. In those cases, it might be beneficial to use the information from both forms. I plan to perform some experiments on this soon.</p>\n<p>The data and code for this evaluation can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/reference-matching-evaluation\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/CrossRef/reference-matching-evaluation</a>.

She added so much and with such energy and intelligence to everything she got involved in, always bringing human attention and creativity.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/winners-chris-uksg-2018.jpg\"\nalt=\"Chris was also on the winning team at 2018&amp;rsquo;s UKSG quiz!\" width=\"50%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Chris was also on the winning team at 2018&rsquo;s UKSG quiz!</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/uksg-chris-2018.jpg\"\nalt=\"Ed, Amanda, and Chris: the Crossref contingent of the winning quiz team\" width=\"50%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Ed, Amanda, and Chris: the Crossref contingent of the winning quiz team</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>In her talk at the 5:AM altmetrics conference she brought together technical detail, big-picture ideas, and her own particular passion. Her opening words were “My name is Christine and I’m a recovering fish scientist”. Never afraid to bring her personal brand of humour into the workplace, her opening slide was a photograph of her covered in rats. That presentation was the first time that much of the audience really understood our service. Having cracked the messaging for us, she was due to give the same talk at our annual meeting in Toronto a few months later…</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/5am-rats.png\"\nalt=\"Chris&amp;rsquo;s opening slide at her 5:AM talk\" width=\"50%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Chris&rsquo;s opening slide at her 5:AM talk</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/5am-chris.jpg\"\nalt=\"Chris giving her now legendary talk at 5:AM on Event Data\" width=\"50%\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Chris giving her now legendary talk at 5:AM on Event Data</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n<p>Many of us were in Toronto for that meeting; it was two weeks after we’d heard the news of her diagnosis. Some of us were able to visit her in the hospital where she told us of her and Dave’s decision to bring forward their wedding plans. It was a bittersweet announcement but, clearly, they adored each other and were determined to be happy together despite the challenging times ahead.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months, even when she had little energy to spare, Chris popped in (virtually) to chat and update us, share pictures and, selflessly, to see how we were doing.

That means we&rsquo;re your first port of call for questions and your agreement will be direct with us. This is a very good thing because we have agreed and will continue to agree the best possible set-up for our collective membership. Similarity Check participants need to take action to confirm the new terms with us as soon as possible and before 31st August 2019. Instructions will be circulated early June via email.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Many of our members use <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check\">Similarity Check</a> which gives their editors reduced-rate access to Turnitin’s iThenticate system for plagiarism checking. Some use Similarity Check directly and some as part of a submission system.</p>\n<p>The service launched in 2008 when we <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/news/2008-06-19-crosscheck-plagiarism-screening-service-launches-today\">announced our initial partnership with Turnitin</a>. Since then it&rsquo;s gone from strength to strength and now has over 60 million full-text documents (from over 87 thousand titles) available for text comparison and almost 1500 members using the service.</p>\n<p>The way that the Similarity Check arrangement works is changing, and it’s important that users know what’s happening. We have worked with Turnitin to set up a process that will transition participants easily and swiftly into the upgraded service with no access interruptions to iThenticate access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-is-changing-and-why\">So, what is changing and why?</h2>\n<p>We know that Similarity Check is a critical service for our members, and we want to improve people&rsquo;s experience of using it. So, in consultation with members, we’ve strengthened the service by updating our relationship with Turnitin to consolidate all the components of the service under our care and stewardship. From next week, Similarity Check participants will move from having an agreement with Turnitin to one with Crossref. And at Crossref, we have a new agreement with Turnitin as the technology provider for the service.</p>\n<p>The new arrangement puts us in a strong position to improve support and drive future improvements of the system. Representing our collective membership, we’ve agreed better terms than what people have today and what members would get acting individually.</p>\n<p>There are five key changes specifically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Members&rsquo; Similarity Check service agreement will be with us and not Turnitin.</li>\n<li>Per-document checking fees will be invoiced by us, and not Turnitin. They’ll be included in members&rsquo; regular invoices, reducing international transfer fees for many.</li>\n<li>The first 100 documents checked each year will be free of charge.</li>\n<li>Turnitin will operate as a vendor for Crossref. We’ve already agreed a range of additions to their technology roadmap. Turnitin will remain responsible for fixing any bugs or technical issues with the system, but we&rsquo;re in a stronger position to ensure these are fixed quickly.</li>\n<li>Users will get training and on-boarding support from Crossref. This will cover both how to use the interface and how to interpret the results.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whats-staying-the-same\">What’s staying the same?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The system itself and how it&rsquo;s accessed</strong> - people&rsquo;s logins will stay exactly the same and nothing will change about how participants have their systems set up.</li>\n<li><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/fees/#similarity-check-fees\">fees</a></strong> - the annual Similarity Check fee and the per-document checking fees will remain at the same level (although under the new arrangement users will get the first 100 documents each year for free - see &ldquo;what&rsquo;s changing&rdquo; above!)</li>\n<li><strong>Your service obligations</strong> - members still need to make at least 90% of all their journal article content available for Turnitin to index. This is achieved through the dedicated full-text URLs that members register in their metadata.</li>\n<li><strong>Licensing and privacy</strong> - there are no changes to the licensing of members&rsquo; content or the privacy requirements for Turnitin’s use of member content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"for-existing-users\">For existing users</h2>\n<p>We’ve worked closely with Turnitin to ensure an easy transition to the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/terms/\">new Crossref terms</a>. You can transition to the new terms at any stage from next week through to 31st August, and Turnitin will end your contract with them in the month you take that action.</p>\n<p>Next week, we’ll email your main Crossref membership contact with a link to a form asking them to click-through accept the new terms. This will confirm and commence the transition process.</p>\n<p>You’ll then need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay your final Turnitin invoice, which will be sent at the end of the month you complete the form. This will cover your per-document checking fees up to the 25th of that month.</li>\n<li>Continue to use iThenticate as usual.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your service agreement will officially move from the Turnitin agreement to the Crossref agreement on the 25th of the month that you complete the transition form. The next Similarity Check invoices you receive will be from Crossref in January 2020 and will include your Similarity Check annual fee and your per-document checking fees for the remainder of 2019.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t transitioned to the new agreement by 31st August, you risk losing access to the iThenticate system as Turnitin will not be able to automatically renew your direct contract.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about these changes, do contact our <a href=\"mailto:member@crossref.org\">membership specialist</a>. We’ll be in touch next week with a link to a new form where you’ll be able to check your details and accept the new agreement directly with us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"for-prospective-users\">For prospective users</h2>\n<p>When you apply to participate in Similarity Check you will be accepting terms directly with Crossref and not Turnitin. Eligible members can apply any time from next week.</p>\n<h2 id=\"any-questions\">Any questions?</h2>\n<p>There are many benefits to this new set-up, but we understand these things can be a bit of a hassle. We&rsquo;ve welcomed a new colleague (say hello to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/kathleen-luschek\">Kathleen</a>!) to help people transition and get the best from their use of Similarity Check.

Over the past year we’ve been encouraging all of our members to review the metadata they are sending us and find out which gaps need filling by looking at their <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">Participation Report</a>.</p>\n<p>The metadata elements that are tracked in Participation Reports are mostly beyond the standard bibliographic information that is used to identify a work. They are important because they provide context: they tell the reader how the research was funded, what license it’s published under, and more about its authors via links to their <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID</a> profiles. And while this metadata is all available through our APIs, we also display much of it to readers through our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/\">Crossmark</a> service.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/crossmark.png\" alt=“the crossmark box\" height=\"448px\" width=\"350px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<p>Crossmark is also about providing context. It is a button placed on content, which when clicked on brings up a pop-up box that tells the reader about significant updates such as corrections and retractions, together with other information about the publishing and editorial processes that have been applied to the content ahead of publication.</p>\n<p>The Crossmark box can display information about authors, funders and licenses. In addition, our members can add “More information” and often do in the form of publication history, links to supporting materials, and peer review information. All of this supporting information helps the reader assess how well the content has been - and continues to be - curated by the publisher.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whos-in\">Who’s in?</h3>\n<p>250 Crossref members have signed up to use Crossmark (it’s an add-on service with its own <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/fees/#crossmark-fees\">fees</a>). Though optional, some star pupils have even added Crossmark to their backfile content and as a result have Crossmark coverage on 99% of their content (kudos to PLOS, Rockefeller University Press and the societies represented by KAMJE, to name a few).</p>\n<p>At the other extreme, some have applied Crossmark to less than 10% - these tend to be members with backfile content going back many decades, who are just implementing Crossmark for their more recent published content. Crossmark coverage is one of the things tracked in Participation Reports - pop over and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">take a look</a> if you want to see what your organization is doing.</p>\n<p>So what additional metadata has been registered by members using Crossmark? (data snapshot from our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/\">REST API</a> April 2019):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>8,711,500 content items have some Crossmark metadata</li>\n<li>104,650 updates to content have been registered. Of these</li>\n<li>55,000 are corrections and 28,000 errata</li>\n<li>16,000 are new versions or new editions</li>\n<li>2,700 are retractions and 1,280 are withdrawals</li>\n<li>4,830,510 content items have some custom metadata, which appears in the More Information section of the Crossmark box. The most common metadata provided here is publication history, followed by copyright statements, the peer review method used, and whether the item has been checked for originality using Similarity Check.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"some-news-on-clicks-and-views\">Some news on clicks and views</h3>\n<p>We’ve been collecting usage statistics more or less since the Crossmark service launched in 2012, but have lacked a suitable way to share them. This will change later this year! In preparation, I’ve been digging around in the data and uncovered some interesting things.</p>\n<p>I was able to do a degree of comparison between Crossmark usage against overall article views using PLOS articles as they make their usage data openly available. I spot-checked fifteen articles and found that most of them had a monthly number of clicks on the Crossmark button in the low-twenties, regardless of the number of total page views the article had received.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/crossmark-plos-stats.png\" alt=“graph of crossmark clicks vs article views\" height=\"267px\" width=\"600px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<p>The highly viewed paper above shows relatively very few clicks on the Crossmark button, whereas on the paper with fewer views, below, clicks on the button follow the overall pattern of usage.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/crossmark-plos-stats-2.png\" alt=“graph of crossmark clicks vs article views\" height=\"267px\" width=\"600px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<p>It’s not unreasonable to suppose that a paper with very high usage has a higher proportion of lay readers visiting it, whereas a more niche paper is being visited by those with a research interest. This is encouraging, as it suggests researchers are interested in checking the status of the content and the additional “trust signals” that the Crossmark box can provide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-pages-vs-pdfs\">Web pages vs PDFs</h3>\n<p>We track the number of clicks on the Crossmark button in PDFs separately to those that come from web pages. (There are some that we can’t determine, usually because the link behind the button has been incorrectly formatted, but for most members these are minimal.)</p>\n<p>I looked at the 30 members with most Crossmark coverage, and averaged the number of clicks over a six month period in 2018. For two thirds of these members, clicks on the Crossmark button on their web pages exceed those in their PDFs, but there are also definite outliers.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/crossmark-pdf-html.png\" alt=“graph of crossmark clicks vs article views\" height=\"370px\" width=\"600px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<p>Some are easily explained: member #6 hasn’t put the Crossmark button in any of their PDFs, while member #21 has <em>only</em> put it in their PDFs. Member 10 has the button on its article landing pages hidden in a “more information” section that the reader has to click to expand.</p>\n<p>That said, member #20 has the button displayed prominently next to the article title but gets 85% of Crossmark clicks from PDFs. There’s no obvious subject bias - four of the members above are physics publishers - two have many more PDF clicks, two have more HTML.</p>\n<p>None of the findings above contain nearly enough data to draw any definitive conclusions, but I hope they pique your interest to find out more when we make Crossmark usage statistics available to all members later this year.

For years the service has been heavily used by students, editors, researchers, and publishers eager to match and link references.</p>\n<p>We had changes to the service planned for the first half of this year - an upgraded reference matching algorithm, a more modern interface, etc. In the spirit of openness and transparency, part of our project plan was to communicate these pending changes to STQ users well in advance of our 30 April completion date. What would users think? Could they help us improve upon our plans?</p>\n<p>About a month ago, I reached out to the 21,000 plus users we had on record of using STQ since January 2018. We received nearly 85 responses from the messages we sent. Questions ranged from: if we were making changes, would PubMed ID matching be supported? To: What about the reliability of the returned reference links? And: Could we better accommodate larger reference lists?</p>\n<p>Many of the users we heard from told us how STQ was critical to their work. I read all these messages. The concerns raised by users were legitimate and much appreciated. We reassessed our project timeline and plans, and decided to shift course. So, what <em>are</em> we doing?</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-changing\">What’s changing?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The previous hurdle of having to register your email address simply to return reference links was confusing and unnecessary. We removed it.</li>\n<li>We previously limited the number of monthly reference links to 5,000 per email address. Most didn’t reach the limit, but those who did were frustrated by it and/or found ways around it. We want you to match and register as many references as possible, so we removed the monthly limit too.</li>\n<li>Many of you with long reference lists found that you were occasionally reaching our limit of 30,000 characters per submission. Once again, we want you to match and register as many references as possible so we removed the character limit altogether and instead are just looking at the number of references per submission. We now provide space for 1,000 references per submission (We checked. The most references we have ever received via the STQ form in one submission was around 750. Thus, we rounded up.).</li>\n<li>We did make a change to the backend of the service. We updated <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/matchmaker-matchmaker-make-me-a-match/\">the algorithm</a> we use to return reference links. We think it’s <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/reference-matching-for-real-this-time/\">an improvement</a>. Let us know how you find it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whats-remaining-the-same\">What’s remaining the same?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Core functionality. It&rsquo;s all in the name. Retrieve DOIs for journal articles, books, and chapters by cutting and pasting a reference or reference list into a simple query box.</li>\n<li>PubMed ID matching. You use it. You need it. We’re keeping it.</li>\n<li>Deposits. You’ll still need an email address for this, but we won’t ask for it until you’re at the deposit screen.</li>\n<li>The interface. We’re still eager to give the user interface a much-needed refresh, but, as many users pointed out to us, there’s still some core functionality that’s important that we need to retain with any interface update. For instance, you need to be able to easily copy and paste reference links into your reference list. That functionality isn’t going anywhere.</li>\n<li>Resetting reference links. Submit references, match, reset, and repeat. Many users like the reset button. It’s not going anywhere either.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"xml-queries\">XML queries</h3>\n<p>The change to the backend of the service that I mentioned above is not confined to reference matching and depositing for STQ users. XML queries for reference matching are also now powered by that new backend. We think it’s a seamless transition, but if you find it is not, please let us know.</p>\n<p>I’m excited for these changes and hope you are too.

The nominating committee will prioritize maintaining representation of members having both commercial and non-commercial business models, in addition to continuing to seek balance across factors such as gender, ethnic and racial background, geography, and sector.</p>\n<p>The Board voted in March 2019 that balance according to size (based on revenue tier) will be achieved by a 2019 slate consisting of one revenue tier 1 seat (small) and 4 revenue 2 seats (large), and a 2020 slate consisting of 4 revenue tier 1 seats and 2 revenue tier 2 seats <em>(see <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/bylaws\">Crossref&rsquo;s amended Bylaws</a> on the Crossref website)</em>.</p>\n<p>The Committee is made up of three board members not up for election, and two non-board members.

As the invoices for the first quarter of 2019 have recently hit your inboxes, I thought I’d provide a timely reminder about this in case you spot this problem on your invoice.</p>\n<p>This problem is usually the result of metadata being registered that makes it look as though the content was current, despite the fact that it was backlist. This post will show you what to do if you spot this problem in your latest invoice - and more importantly, how you can avoid this situation in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-current-and-backlist-content-registration-fees\">About current and backlist Content Registration fees</h3>\n<p>There are different fees for registering content depending on whether it’s current (this year and the previous two years - 2017, ‘18, and ‘19) or backlist (older than that). As an example, it’s $1 each for a current journal article, and $0.15 for each backlist article. So, if you’ve incorrectly registered your content as published in 2019 when actually it was published in 2012, your quarterly invoice will overcharge you based on the metadata discrepancy.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/quarterly_invoice_test.png\" alt=\"Sample quarterly deposit invoice\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<ol>\n<li>We send you the quarterly deposit invoice at the end of each quarter. This example is an invoice for all deposits of the first quarter of 2018 for username ‘test’ - months January, February, and March.</li>\n<li>The BY code represents backlist (or, back year) content (journal article, in this example). Backlist content is charged at $0.15 per content item.</li>\n<li>The CY code represents current year content (journal article, in this example, although you can see that this invoice has charges for other content items as well). Current year content is charged at $1 per content item.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"determining-whether-content-is-current-or-backlist\">Determining whether content is current or backlist</h3>\n<p>A record is determined to be either a backlist or current year deposit based on the metadata that you deposit with us. If you use our helper tools - <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata Manager</a> or the <a href=\"https://apps.crossref.org/webDeposit/\" target=\"_blank\">web deposit form</a> - the system looks at the information you’ve entered into the “publication date” field. If you deposit XML with us, it looks at the date in the <code>&lt;publication_date&gt;</code> element. And we look at each individual item separately—so even if you’ve put a publication date at journal level, you still need to put it at the journal article level too.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sometimes we find that deposits mistakenly include the deposit date in place of the publication date. These two dates - the deposit date and the publication date - are not necessarily one and the same, especially if you are depositing backlist content. Please take care to double check this before you submit your deposit(s).</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-to-do-if-you-think-youve-registered-the-wrong-publication-date\">What to do if you think you’ve registered the wrong publication date</h3>\n<p>As you can only update a publication date by running a full redeposit, it’s important to get it right the first time. If you’ve registered the wrong publication date and have received an invoice for the wrong amount, please redeposit your content and then <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">get in contact with us</a>. If you do this as soon as you spot the error, we’ll be able to send a new invoice for the correct amount.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Here’s to year one!","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/heres-to-year-one/","published":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Our Ambassador Program is now one year old, and we are thrilled at how the first 12 months have gone.

In addition to translating key messages, slide decks, and other educational materials, our ambassadors (and some members - thanks also!) helped us in the production of a series of short videos. We now have videos available for each of the Crossref services in nine languages including English, French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Bahasa Indonesia. You can see in the chart below, that although our English videos have the most views (this is the default language), others have also experienced a lot of visitors, particularly notable are the Chinese and Spanish language videos. This underscores the importance of further support in non-English languages, as our series of multi-lingual webinars also demonstrated.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Service-video-plays-ambassador-blog.png\" alt=\"Service video plays\" width=\"500px\" />\n</p>\n<p>In 2018 we ran webinars in Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish and Arabic. Several ambassadors have taken a lead in running these webinars in their local languages with assistance from Crossref staff on producing materials and answering questions on the day. Spanish language webinars saw record numbers of attendees from a range of different countries, and our Russian webinar recordings have been viewed over 200 times. We will be continuing to offer more webinars in different time zones and languages, and the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/webinars/\">recordings</a> are always available for anyone who can’t attend on the day.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Arabic-webinar-ambassador blog.png\" alt=\"Arabic webinar\" width=\"500px\" />\n</p>\n<p>Our ambassadors have also been helping us improve and expand our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/events/\">LIVE local events</a>. Last year we held events in Japan, South Africa, Russia, Germany, Brazil and India. Ambassadors help by providing recommendations on venues, accommodation, guest speakers, or even attending and speaking at the event themselves. Some run their own Crossref events which we can help provide materials and also represent Crossref at related industry events in their region. You may have had the chance to meet some of our ambassadors at our annual event in Toronto last November as well.</p>\n<p>As our ambassadors are our representatives, acting as our eyes and ears in the wider community, it is important that they are kept up to date with new developments and have good opportunities to report back to us. The ambassador team has participated in beta-testing of a number of new initiatives including our new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/member-setup/metadata-manager/\">Metadata Manager</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">Participation Reports</a> and our upcoming Community Forum. By providing feedback from their own user perspective and from how they anticipate those in their communities will view and use these tools, it enables us get better insights into how an initiative might work before launching it more widely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-plans\">Future Plans</h2>\n<p>Initial feedback on the program has been overwhelmingly positive, both from the ambassadors themselves and the wider Crossref community, so we’re looking at what we can do to hone the program over time. In 2019 we will be welcoming some more ambassadors to the team to further support our global community. We want to support our ambassadors, so we don’t foresee the group growing to the point where there are too many ambassadors for us to be able to engage with. You can read about the team and where they are based, as well as all about the new ambassadors we have welcomed so far this year, on <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/our-ambassadors/\">Our Ambassadors</a> page.</p>\n<p>This year our ambassadors will be involved when we launch our online community forum (more to come on that soon). They’re already helping with the task-force that is advising on our new documentation, and we’ll be providing them with further training on Crossref tools and services. We also have more webinars and LIVE locals in the pipeline.

For those disposing publishers looking for an easy, do-it-yourself option for transferring ownership of your journal, I suggest you review that blog post. But, whether you choose to process the transfer yourself via Metadata Manager or need some help from <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/paul-davis/\">Paul</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/shayn-smulyan/\">Shayn</a>, or myself, there’s more to a transfer than just the click of a transfer button or the submission of an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support@crossref.org</a>, as I’m sure those of you who have been through a title transfer can attest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prepping-your-title-transfer\">Prepping your title transfer</h3>\n<p>Sometimes members get on the other side of a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/what-can-often-change-but-always-stays-the-same/\">title transfer</a> and find you’re encountering problems even if you followed the process for transferring titles. You might find you can register new content for the new title against your own prefix without any issues. But you are not able to update the metadata for backfile content after we’ve made the transfer.</p>\n<p>When we investigate, the problem is usually that the DOIs you’re trying to update don’t exist in our system yet. This means the deposit isn’t considered an update to the content, it’s considered a new deposit. And you don’t have permission to do that, since you’re effectively attempting to register new content to a prefix that is not your own.</p>\n<p>This problem is because the former publisher didn’t ever register the DOIs with us - even though they’ve been displaying them on their website. This is bad practice and isn’t in keeping with our membership terms, but it does sometimes happen.</p>\n<p>Before you request a title transfer, do check with the former publisher that they’ve definitely registered all the DOIs that they’ve been displaying and distributing to their readership. You can spot check this yourself by following a few of the DOI links and checking that they resolve to the right place. If you want a full list of DOIs registered to a journal title, our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/06members/51depositor.html\" target=\"_blank\">depositor reports</a> are the place to start. Depositor Reports list all DOIs deposited for a title on a publisher-by-publisher basis. Or, alternatively, if you know the journal cite ID, the unique internal, Crossref identifier for the journal, you can bypass the publisher-by-publisher title list (in my example you’d need to replace my fictional 123456 journal ID with your journal’s cite ID):</p>\n<center>`http://data.crossref.org/depositorreport?pubid=J123456`</center>\n<h3 id=\"top-tips-for-a-pain-free-title-transfer\">Top tips for a pain-free title transfer</h3>\n<p>If your organization has gained new titles, you’ve checked the depositor report for your new journal and are happy that all the existing DOIs have been registered, then you’re ready to process the transfer. Here are three key steps to ensure a pain-free transfer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you are not acquiring all existing journal articles as part of this transfer, you’ll need to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support@crossref.org</a> to confirm the details. Once we have those details sorted, we&rsquo;ll transfer ownership for the select, specified articles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Carefully check the existing metadata associated with your new titles - some metadata provided for <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/text-and-data-mining\">text and data mining</a> or <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/\">Similarity Check</a> are publisher-specific and must be updated or <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/115003564483-Removing-metadata-from-a-record\" target=\"_blank\">removed</a> when content is acquired by another member.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the metadata supplied is fine, you just need to update the URLs to direct DOIs to your content. You can do this by sending us a <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213022526\" target=\"_blank\">URL update file</a> or by <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213022486\" target=\"_blank\">redepositing the metadata</a> with the correct URLs.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you need to update more than the URLs, you should redeposit the metadata with the correct information plus the correct URLs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note: If you, as the disposing publisher, are prepared to transfer your journal to an acquiring publisher, and would like to transfer ownership of the journal and all existing journal articles, please try your new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/resolutions-2019-journal-title-transfers-metadata-manager/\">title transfer via Metadata Manager</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"on-the-other-side\">On the other side</h3>\n<p>If you follow the steps I’ve outlined above, you should get to the other side of your title transfer with few problems and are likely to encounter smooth metadata seas ahead. That said, some of our members follow these steps to a tee and still are faced with occasional transfer-related problems.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the previous journal owner used a different scheme to assign timestamps and now you’re receiving <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/215789303-Error-and-warning-messages-\" target=\"_blank\">mysterious timestamp errors</a> when you deposit. Or, that same previous owner made a mistake with a previous deposit and accidentally submitted more than one journal title record.

If so, please reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support@crossref.org</a> and we’ll help solve what are surely confounding problems, since you’ve undoubtedly read this post in its entirety and taken heed of the above advice.</p>\n<p>As always, if you have questions, need guidance as you’re working through this process, or have recommendations on how we can improve title transfers, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support@crossref.org</a>.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Work through your PID problems on the PID Forum","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/work-through-your-pid-problems-on-the-pid-forum/","published":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"As self-confessed PID nerds, we’re big fans of a persistent identifier.

The proposed ideas covered a spectrum of possibilities for ROR, highlighting the following themes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"ror-as-seamlessly-integrated-and-sometimes-invisible-infrastructure\">ROR as seamlessly-integrated and sometimes invisible infrastructure</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Integration between and within existing systems (and in new ones!)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-detection of ROR IDs for example in manuscript tracking and funding application platforms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As such, researchers don&rsquo;t ever have to be responsible for knowing what a ROR is and using it appropriately - the systems they use will do this for them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"ror-as-a-critical-piece-of-funder-workflows-and-infrastructure\">ROR as a critical piece of funder workflows and infrastructure</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Demonstrate to funders how ROR can help them analyze impact of research they fund</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conduct outreach with key international funders, especially those interested in open infrastructure</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make funders aware of ROR and encourage them to adopt and mandate use of ROR IDs - involve funders at the beginning to collaborate on technology</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrate ROR with existing systems and identifiers already in use by funders and other stakeholders</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"ror-as-a-trusted-registry-collaborative-partner-and-responsible-steward\">ROR as a trusted registry, collaborative partner, and responsible steward</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Culturally sensitive, inclusive, and respectful of what countries are already doing with regard to organizational identifiers, partnering with national bodies working on this and mapping ROR IDs to locally used identifiers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Involve the institutions listed in the registry early on as well as CRIS systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interoperability with existing communities and governance bodies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Workflows to support trust and responsible management of organizational metadata, with policies and procedures for long-term curation and maintenance of records</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-were-hearing\">What we&rsquo;re hearing</h2>\n<p>Now that the ROR MVR is here, we&rsquo;re hearing some really good questions about the data we&rsquo;re capturing, how it can be used, and how we&rsquo;ll be maintaining the registry going forward. We wanted to take a moment to respond to some of these questions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-criteria-for-being-listed-in-ror-what-is-a-research-organization\">What is the criteria for being listed in ROR? What is a &ldquo;research organization&rdquo;?</h3>\n<p>We define the notion of &ldquo;research organization&rdquo; quite broadly as any organization that conducts, produces, manages, or touches research. This is in line with ROR&rsquo;s stated scope, which is to address the affiliation use case and be able to identify which organizations are associated with which research outputs. We use &ldquo;affiliation&rdquo; to describe any formal relationship between a researcher and an organization associated with researchers, including but not limited to their employer, educator, funder, or scholarly society.</p>\n<h3 id=\"will-ror-map-organizational-hierarchies\">Will ROR map organizational hierarchies?</h3>\n<p>No - ROR is focused on being a top-level registry of organizations so we can address the fundamental affiliation use case, and provide a critical source of metadata that can interoperate with other institutional identifiers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ror-ids-are-cool---what-can-i-do-with-them\">ROR IDs are cool - what can I do with them?</h3>\n<p>Now that we have built our MVR, we will be working to incorporate ROR IDs into relevant pieces of the scholarly communication infrastructure. If you are a publisher, funder, metadata provider, research office, or anyone else interested in capturing affiliations, please get in touch with us to discuss how we might coordinate. If you are a developer, you are welcome to start playing around with the API: <a href=\"https://api.ror.org/organizations\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.ror.org/organizations</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theres-an-error-in-my-organizations-ror-record-----can-you-fix-it\">There&rsquo;s an error in my organization&rsquo;s ROR record &mdash; can you fix it?</h3>\n<p>For the time being, please email <a href=\"mailto:info@ror.org\">info@ror.org</a> to request an update to an existing record in ROR or request that a new record be added. We will formalize our data management policies and procedures in the next stage of the project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-rors-relationship-to-other-organizational-identifiers\">What is ROR&rsquo;s relationship to other organizational identifiers?</h3>\n<p>For ROR to be useful, it needs to augment the current offerings in a way that is open, trusted, complementary, and collaborative, and not intentionally competitive. We are committed to providing a service that the community finds helpful and not duplicative, and enables as many connections as possible between organization records across systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-have-my-own-dataset-of-institutional-affiliations-----can-i-give-it-to-ror\">I have my own dataset of institutional affiliations &mdash; can I give it to ROR?</h3>\n<p>We are always happy to hear about other efforts to capture affiliation data. Please get in touch with us to discuss how we might coordinate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-ror-support-multiple-languages-and-character-sets\">Can ROR support multiple languages and character sets?</h3>\n<p>GRID already supports multiple languages and character sets, so by extension ROR will have this enabled as well. Here is one example: <a href=\"https://ror.org/01k4yrm29\" target=\"_blank\">https://ror.org/01k4yrm29</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-will-ror-handle-curation-ie-updating-records-if-an-organization-changes-its-name-or-ceases-to-exist\">How will ROR handle curation, i.e., updating records if an organization changes its name or ceases to exist?</h3>\n<p>The curation and long-term management of records will be a cornerstone of our efforts in 2019 and we hope to release a working set of policies and procedures soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next-for-ror\">What&rsquo;s next for ROR</h2>\n<p>Now that we have our MVR, what happens next for ROR? We&rsquo;re eager to sustain the momentum from January&rsquo;s stakeholder meeting at the same time we know there are some longer-term plans to put in place, and so we&rsquo;re looking at both some immediate tasks as well as bigger-picture questions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"product-development\">Product development</h3>\n<p>We have a few to-do items on our list following the launch of the MVR to keep everything running smoothly while we develop a comprehensive long-term product roadmap.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rewrite some of the code for both the API and the OpenRefine reconciler</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Address a few bugs in our repos</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide guidance for troubleshooting issues</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communicate our processes for users to request changes, report bugs, and suggest features</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a reminder, you can access the existing code in Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/ror-community\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ror-community</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"policy-development\">Policy development</h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been emphasizing here and in community conversations that our primary focus now turns to formulating policies and procedures to ensure the successful management of ROR data over the long term. This is something we can&rsquo;t (and shouldn&rsquo;t) do on our own &mdash; we want to work with community stakeholders to develop the right solutions and establish the right frameworks. We understand the urgency of firming up these policies, but we are also aware that something this important can take time to complete and is not something to rush into lightly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"community-development\">Community development</h3>\n<p>To help guide the next stages of the project, we are putting out an open call for participation in the ROR community advisory group. Advisory group members will be involved in giving input on data management, testing out new features, giving feedback on the product roadmap, and discussing ideas for events and outreach. We plan to convene this advisory group through bimonthly calls and asynchronous communication channels through the end of the year. We hope you will consider joining us! Please email <a href=\"mailto:info@ror.org\">info@ror.org</a> if you are interested.</p>\n<p>For those who want to stay informed about the project but not necessarily be part of the advisory group, you have other options!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sign up for our mailing list (via the footer at <a href=\"https://www.ror.org\" target=\"_blank\">ror.org</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Join our community on Slack (<a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/ror-community\" target=\"_blank\">www.tinyurl.com/ror-community</a>),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow us on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ResearchOrgs\" target=\"_blank\">@ResearchOrgs</a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also always drop us a line at <a href=\"mailto:info@ror.org\">info@ror.org</a>, and let us know if you&rsquo;d ever like to set up a meeting or conference call to talk about the project in more detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Community engagement has been vital to ROR&rsquo;s beginnings and will likewise be critically important for the next steps that we take. As both a registry of identifiers and a community of stakeholders involved in building open scholarly infrastructure, ROR depends on guidance and involvement at multiple levels. Thank you for being part of the journey thus far, and for joining us on the road that lies ahead. 🦁</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Request for feedback on grant identifier metadata","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/request-for-feedback-on-grant-identifier-metadata/","published":"Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"We first announced plans to investigate identifiers for grants in 2017 and are almost ready to violate the first rule of grant identifiers which is “they probably should not be called grant identifiers”....","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Patricia Feeney","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>We first announced plans to investigate identifiers for grants in 2017 and are almost ready to violate the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/global-persistent-identifiers-for-grants-awards-and-facilities/\">first rule of grant identifiers</a> which is “they probably should not be called grant identifiers”. Research support extends beyond monetary grants and awards, but our end goal is to make grants easy to cite, track, and identify, and ‘Grant ID’ resonates in a way other terms do not. The truth is in the metadata, and we intend to collect (and our funder friends are prepared to provide) information about a number of funding types. Hopefully we encompass all of them.</p>\n<p>Our technical &amp; metadata working group (a subset of the broader <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders\">Funder Advisory Group</a>) includes folks from Children&rsquo;s Tumor Foundation, Europe PMC, European Research Council, JST, OSTI (DOE), Smithsonian, Swiss National Science Foundation, UKRI, Wellcome, as well as colleagues at DataCite and ORCID.</p>\n<p>They have provided a wealth of funding data and feedback, and together we’ve come up with a metadata schema that works for us. Just as important - does this set of metadata meet your needs? Did we miss something? Let us know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-details\">The details</h3>\n<p>For those of you familiar with Crossref Content Registration, Grant IDs will have their own dedicated schema that differs from our publication schema. The Grant ID schema will follow some of the same conventions as we’ll be using the same system to process the files (which will be XML) but since we are collecting metadata for a new community and moving beyond published content, this is an opportunity to rethink how we handle some basics like person names and dates.</p>\n<p>Each Grant ID can be assigned to multiple projects. The metadata within each project includes basics like titles, descriptions, and investigator information (including affiliations) as well as funding information. Funders will supply funder information (including funder identifiers from the Crossref Funder Registry) as well as information about funding types and amounts.</p>\n<p>A major accomplishment of the group was to develop a simple taxonomy of types of funding. Supported types are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>award</li>\n<li>contract</li>\n<li>grant</li>\n<li>salary-award</li>\n<li>endowment</li>\n<li>secondment</li>\n<li>loan</li>\n<li>facilities</li>\n<li>equipment</li>\n<li>seed-funding</li>\n<li>fellowship</li>\n<li>training-grant</li>\n<li>other</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funding involves more than monetary grants or awards and we’ve attempted to capture the broad categories of funding types. This list is taken from types of funding as defined by our participating funder organizations. We anticipate this list will evolve over time.</p>\n<p>Ready to dig in? The schema and documentation are <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/grantID-schema/\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a>. We will actively take feedback until the end of February 2019. We hope to begin implementation soon after that.

We have deployed a fix, but it is running on billions of records, and so we don’t expect it to be complete until mid-April.</p>\n<p>Note that the Cited-by API that our members use appears to be <em>unaffected</em> by this problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-gory-details\">The gory details</h2>\n<p>When a Crossref member registers metadata for a publication, they often include references. Sometimes the member will also include DOIs in the references, but often they don’t. When they don’t include a DOI in the reference, Crossref tries to match the reference to metadata in the Crossref system. If we succeed, we add the DOI of the matched record to the reference metadata. If we fail, we append the reference to an ever-growing list which we re-process on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<p>You may have seen that <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/reference-matching-for-real-this-time/\">the R&amp;D team has been doing work to improve our reference matching system</a>. We will soon be rolling out a new reference matching process that will increase recall significantly.</p>\n<p>But while testing our new reference matching approach, we started to see inconsistent results with our existing legacy reference matching system. When we implemented new regression tests, we noticed that, even when using our legacy system, we were consistently getting <em>better</em> results than were reflected in the metadata we exposed via our APIs. For example, we would pick a random Crossref DOI record that included 3 matched references, and when we tried matching all the references in the record again using our existing technology, we would get <em>more</em> matched references than were reported in the metadata.</p>\n<p>At first, we thought this might have something to do with sequencing issues. For example, that article <em>A</em> might cite article <em>B</em>, but somehow article <em>A</em> would get its DOI registered with Crossref prior to article <em>B</em>. In this theoretical case, we would initially fail to match the reference, but it would eventually get matched as we continued to reprocess our unmatched references. But this wasn’t the issue. And the problem was not with the matching technology we are using. Instead, we discovered a problem with the way we process references on deposit.</p>\n<p>When a member deposits references with Crossref, each reference has to include a member-defined key that is unique to each reference they are depositing in the DOI record. When we match a reference- we report to the members that we matched the reference with key X to DOI Y. The problem is that sometimes members would deposit references with an empty key. If there was only one such reference, then, technically, it would pass our test for making sure the key was unique within the record. So we would process the reference, and match it, and report it via our Cited-by service, but later in the process, when we went to include the matched DOI in the reference section of our API metadata, we’d skip including DOIs for references that had blank keys. The reference itself would be included in the metadata, it would just appear that we hadn’t matched it to a DOI when we actually had.</p>\n<p>Again, we estimate this to have resulted in about 11% of the references in our metadata to be missing matched DOIs. We are processing our references again and inserting the correctly matched DOIs in the metadata. We expect the process to complete in mid-April. We will keep everybody up-to-date on the progress of this fix.</p>\n<p>We will also be integrating the new matching system that we’ve developed. As mentioned at the start of this post, this matching system will also increase the recall rate of our reference matching and so, the two changes combined, should result in users seeing a significant increase in the number of matched references included in Crossref metadata.</p>\n<p>And finally, as part of the work that we are doing to improve our reference matching, we are putting a comprehensive testing framework that will make it easier for us to detect inconsistencies and/or regressions in our reference matching.</p>\n<p>Please contact <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">Crossref support</a> with any questions or concerns.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"How Crossref metadata is helping bring migration research in Europe under one roof","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/how-crossref-metadata-is-helping-bring-migration-research-in-europe-under-one-roof/","published":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Conflict, instability and economic conditions are just some of the factors driving new migration into Europe—and European policy makers are in dispute about how to manage and cope with the implications....","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Christine Cormack Wood","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p><em>Conflict, instability and economic conditions are just some of the factors driving new migration into Europe—and European policy makers are in dispute about how to manage and cope with the implications.

The Hub is a web-based platform aimed at helping researchers and policymakers get a quick and comprehensive overview on research in the field of migration studies. This platform will also feature reports on specific fields, methodological briefing papers and other relevant content produced by the consortium.</p>\n<p>The core of this Hub will consist of a database providing access to publications, research projects and datasets on migration drivers, and infrastructures, flows, and policies on current and future migration questions, indicators and scenarios. And that’s where our metadata story starts.</p>\n<p>At the tail end of December I had the pleasure of speaking to the four researchers and developers working on this database; Vienna-based researchers Roland Hosner and Meike Palinkas from the <a href=\"https://www.icmpd.org/home/\" target=\"_blank\">International Centre for Migration Policy and Development</a> (ICMPD), Bogdan Taut, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.youngminds.ro/\" target=\"_blank\">YoungMinds</a>, in Bucharest, Romania, and Nathan Levy, currently studying for his PhD at Erasmus University Rotterdam, Department of Public Administration and Sociology, Netherlands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"there-are-four-of-you-can-each-of-you-give-me-a-very-brief-introduction-to-yourselves-and-how-you-fit-into-project\">There are four of you, can each of you give me a very brief introduction to yourselves and how you fit into project?</h3>\n<p><strong>Bogdan:</strong> I’m from YoungMinds, based in Bucharest in Romania. We were the last to join the consortium as the technical developer on the project. I am the project manager of the team, coordinating the technical development of the database.</p>\n<p><strong>Roland:</strong> I am a research officer with the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) in Vienna, and we are leading a part of this research project which deals with the population and implementation of the research database—which is core to the Migration Research Hub, and to the whole project.</p>\n<p><strong>Meike:</strong> I am also a research officer at ICMPD and work together with Roland. I joined the team in September this year.</p>\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’m part of the coordinating team of the overall project of CrossMigration. We are coordinating putting together the Migration Research Hub, the biggest part of which is the migration database. I am based at Erasmus University in Rotterdam and I work for Professor Peter Scholten who is the overall coordinator of the whole project along with Dr. Asya Pisarevskaya.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-long-has-the-project-been-in-progress\">How long has the project been in progress?</h3>\n<p><strong>Roland:</strong> It’s a two-year project than runs from March 2018 to the end of February 2020.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-its-a-two-year-project-and-you-are-10-months-inthat-makes-it-nearly-at-the-halfway-mark-have-you-encountered-any-stumbling-blocks-that-have-held-you-back\">So it’s a two-year project and you are 10 months in—that makes it nearly at the halfway mark. Have you encountered any stumbling blocks that have held you back?</h3>\n<p><strong>Bogdan:</strong> How to put this in a diplomatic way? We are all working around the clock to meet the deadline that we set ourselves and promised to deliver by. We have made the decision to produce the database in stages—very soon we will have the beta version out, so we have something to present. Then we are going to continue populating it with more items from every content type – journal articles, datasets, books, book chapters, reports etc.. At this point the other partners in the consortium can actually use it and work with it to map the fields and find the most recent and relevant literature on their respective subtopics such as migration drivers or migration infrastructures. In the summer when we are confident that it is a sound and attractive tool to be released, we will make it publicly available.</p>\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> In terms of specific deliverables for the project so far, our team has developed a taxonomy for migration research to give the fields a logical structure, and to structure this research database.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-has-crossref-metadata-contributed-to-your-project\">How has Crossref metadata contributed to your project?</h3>\n<p><strong>Bogdan:</strong> We began by discussing all of the sources that need to be in the database and we put together an inventory of publishers, books and book chapters, etc., that would be relevant. Part of the scope of work for YoungMinds was to find ways of extracting information and relevant content from those sources. Once we started to dig into the content we found out that there are relevant aggregators, such as Scopus, Crossref, Web of Science and so on. We actually found Crossref through a recommendation from Scopus, someone there said ‘OK Crossref might be able to help you more’. Then Crossref became one of our main sources for metadata—in terms of basic metadata related to some types of content we gather for our database, such as journals and journal articles.</p>\n<p><strong>Roland:</strong> The more we moved forward, the more we saw how difficult it was to get in touch with each publisher individually, with each journal individually, to try and secure an agreement with them. So, it became very clear to us very quickly that we would not be able to create a properly inclusive database this way and we knew we had to look for partners and make use of existing resources. As we progressed from one conversation to the next we received a lot of advice, and that’s how we found out about Crossref. It soon became clear that Crossref was the ideal source for us because everything that has a DOI can be found in there. We knew if we had an agreement with Crossref then our project is half won, our database is halfway built, perhaps even more. And, then we just need to fill the gaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yes, this is one of Crossref’s key strengths—rather than having individual researchers or individual projects go to each publisher to try to find the appropriate people to talk to and negotiate—you use Crossref.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-of-the-metadata-values-are-important-to-you-what-do-you-extract\">Which of the metadata values are important to you, what do you extract?</h3>\n<p><strong>Roland:</strong> We thought about this a lot at the beginning, what we wanted to include. There are certain key things that are indisputably relevant—such as titles, names of the authors, editors, the year, DOI, dataset and so on, because we always link to the original source—the publisher’s website, or the journal article website. Ideally we would include keywords and abstracts (where they are available) because the richer the information the better. We also wanted to classify the items we have according to the taxonomy the CrossMigration project has established.</p>\n<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> In addition, abstracts and keywords have value for us. We want to apply a logical structure into the taxonomy on migration research, but we need content in order to do that. We need something for the algorithms that YoungMinds have developed to read to in order categorize research accordingly. The body of research on migration is so great and we cannot read through every abstract that’s ever been published on migration. That’s where the value of abstracts and keywords comes in for the Taxonomizer (as we fondly refer to it!).</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-else-would-you-like-to-see-in-the-rest-api-that-isnt-there\">What else would you like to see in the REST API that isn’t there?</h3>\n<p><strong>Roland:</strong> More abstracts! We love abstracts!</p>\n<p><strong>Bogdan:</strong> Our data schema contains more fields, so we need more metadata than we can find from Crossref and other sources. Basically, the publisher’s website would produce the richest data, but it is the hardest to read. We are on a quest to find more sources because our algorithm works better if it has more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"once-its-complete-what-are-your-plans-to-roll-it-out-to-the-wider-world\">Once it’s complete, what are your plans to roll it out to the wider world?</h3>\n<p><strong>Bogdan:</strong> IMISCOE is the leading organization of this consortium and it is in touch with most of the migration experts in Europe, so we already have all the contacts of the relevant people in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Meike:</strong> It’s a tool for helping the community, so once we have all the relevant content inside it, we believe that word will spread relatively easily.</p>\n<h3 id=\"have-you-all-actually-met-in-person\">Have you all actually met in person?</h3>\n<p><strong>Roland:</strong> Yes! Myself and Nathan met at the project kick-off meeting in Rotterdam in March 2018, then we met at a conference in Florence in June that was partly for the consortium but also had other invited experts and scholars. That was where we met face-to-face for the first time—it was just after we signed with YoungMinds for the IT services. And we recently met at another joint conference of IMISCOE and CrossMigration called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CrossMigration/status/1067762112485879808\" target=\"_blank\">&lsquo;Towards the IMISCOE Research Infrastructure of the Future&rsquo;</a>.</p>\n<p><em>[1] Horizon 2020, the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Great speaking to you all and learning a bit about this important project that will help policymakers manage and cope with the implications of migration—and may possibly even help them find ways to influence it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to share how you use our Metadata APIs please contact the <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">Community team</a>.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Zen and the Art of Platform Migration","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/zen-and-the-art-of-platform-migration/","published":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Nowadays we’re all trying to eat healthier, get fitter, be more mindful and stay in the now.

I can sense the panic from here.</p>\n<p>While the [Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale] (<a href=\"https://www.stress.org/holmes-rahe-stress-inventory/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.stress.org/holmes-rahe-stress-inventory/</a>) doesn’t include platform migration as one of the top ten most stressful life events, we hear from our members that it should probably be in there somewhere. There’s so much to think about and plan for - how do you know you’re choosing the right platform partners for the future? How can you be sure that your understanding of what they offer really matches what you need? Will it make it easier for your readers to access your content? What about delays? What if it all breaks on changeover day?</p>\n<p>Gaaaaah!</p>\n<p>With all that to think about, worrying about whether your DOIs will resolve and what the migration will mean for the quality of your Crossref metadata just seems like an unnecessary layer of stress. It is, however, very important to consider this - even before you start thinking about who your platform partners will be. The process of working through these things up front could help you make better decisions, and set you up for success with the project and into the future.</p>\n<p>So, to help you plan ahead, we’ve created a [platform migration guide] (/service-providers/migrating-platforms/) that offers guidance on things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What to consider even before you start selecting a new service provider</li>\n<li>Planning the change over process</li>\n<li>The change over itself (and what that means for your URLs)</li>\n<li>What you should do after the migration is complete</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guide gives advice on how to plan for what you really need right now, and what you’re going to need in the future. For example, what metadata are you going to want to register with us and share with the thousands of industry organizations that make use of the data? What other Crossref services might benefit you in the future? What different content types are in your publishing plans?</p>\n<p>The guide also has a [handy checklist] (/education/member-setup/working-with-a-service-provider/checklist-for-platform-migration/) which you can include in your Request For Proposal documentation, to ensure that you’re asking the right questions of potential suppliers.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve read the [platform migration guide] (/service-providers/migrating-platforms/), [let us know] (mailto:feedback@crossref.org) if there’s anything else you think we should add to it - we’re sure many of you have platform migration stories, and it’s good to share!</p>\n<hr>"},{"id":null,"title":"What can often change, but always stays the same?","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/what-can-often-change-but-always-stays-the-same/","published":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Hello.

Also, as we get a lot of title transfers at this time of year, I thought I’d clarify the difference between a title transfer and a prefix transfer, and the impact of each.</p>\n<p>When you join Crossref, you are provided with a unique prefix, you then add suffixes of your choice to your prefix and this creates the DOIs for your content.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/DOI-structure.png\" alt=\"Structure of a DOI directory suffix and prefix\" width=\"550\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<p>It’s a logical step then to assume you can tell just by looking at a DOI prefix who the current publisher is—but that’s not always the case. Things can (and often do) change. Individual journals get purchased by other publishers, and whole organizations get bought and sold.</p>\n<p>What you can tell from looking at a DOI prefix is who originally registered it, but not necessarily who it currently belongs to. That’s because if a journal (or whole organization) is acquired, DOIs don’t get deleted and re-registered to the new owner. The update will of course be reflected in the relevant metadata, but the prefix itself will stay the same. It never changes—and that’s the whole point, that’s what makes the DOI persistent.</p>\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of how this works internally at Crossref:</p>\n<h3 id=\"title-transfers\">Title transfers</h3>\n<p>Member A acquires a single title from member B. We transfer the title (and all relevant reports) over to member A. Member A must then register new content for that journal on their own prefix. The existing (newly acquired) DOIs maintain the ‘old’ prefix but member A can update metadata against these existing DOIs for that journal. Backfile and current DOIs for that journal may, therefore, have different prefixes—and that’s OK!</p>\n<h3 id=\"organization-transfers\">Organization transfers</h3>\n<p>Member C acquires member D. We move the entire prefix (and all relevant reports) over to Member C, and close down Member D’s account with Crossref. Member C can continue to register DOIs on member D’s prefix (the original prefix) if they want to, or they can use their own existing prefix. So again, backfile and current DOIs for that journal may have different prefixes.</p>\n<p>And by the way, if Member C uses a service provider to register metadata on their behalf, we will simply enable their username to work with the prefix.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-now-easier-to-transfer-titles\">It’s now easier to transfer titles</h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve recently made the process of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/resolutions-2019-journal-title-transfers-metadata-manager/\">transferring journal titles</a> a lot easier with our new Content Registration tool, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata Manager</a>.</p>\n<hr>"},{"id":null,"title":"Myth busting in Mumbai","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/myth-busting-in-mumbai/","published":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"In December, Crossref’s Head of Metadata, Patricia Feeney and I headed to Mumbai for our first ever LIVE local event in India, held in collaboration with Editage.

Around 40% of these new members are smaller organizations who joined through one of the eight <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/\">sponsors</a> we currently have in the country.</p>\n<p>With such a large increase in membership numbers, it seemed timely to visit and meet both our new and longer-standing members face-to-face.

It also gives us a chance to explain in detail how to benefit from the services we offer, as well as keep them informed about any future developments. A special thanks goes to Editage for all their help in organizing, promoting, and running this event with us.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Clarinda Cerejo - LIVE Mumbai.png\" alt=“LIVE Mumbai\" height=\"150px\" width=\"400px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<p>The Mumbai event was held at the Sahara Star hotel and attended by participants from a range of organizations, with varying levels of knowledge about Crossref. Patricia talked about how to register your content and the importance of providing us with accurate and comprehensive metadata. She also introduced our new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/member-setup/metadata-manager/\">Metadata Manager</a> tool, which many participants were excited to hear more about. I gave an overview of Crossref services, with a specific focus on <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/\">Crossmark</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/\">Similarity Check</a>. The afternoon session was run by Editage, and featured a session on ‘<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/editage-workshop-helping-journals-and-publishers-get-closer-to-authors\" target=\"_blank\">Helping journals and publishers to get closer to authors</a>’, followed by a lively debate on research integrity. The debate brought up a number of interesting talking points, including how to attract more students into a career in research, issues around malpractice and plagiarism, and how to improve India’s research culture.</p>\n<p>The Q&amp;A part of the day highlighted a number of myths about Crossref that I thought would be worth detailing here, as other members may benefit from these explanations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-1-crossref-is-a-mark-of-publisher-and-content-quality\">Myth #1: Crossref is a mark of publisher and content quality</h3>\n<p>We have a membership application process where we ask for different types of information and make it clear what the Crossref member <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/terms\">obligations</a> are. Crossref doesn’t assess the quality of its members’ content or verify members’ publication processes and procedures. It’s not our role or part of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/about/\">our mission</a> to do these things.<br>\nIt’s important to remember that content with a Crossref DOI <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/dois-unambiguously-and-persistently-identify-published-trustworthy-citable-online-scholarly-literature-right/\">says nothing about the quality of the content</a>, or that it is peer-reviewed or authoritative.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-2-crossref-archives-content\">Myth #2: Crossref archives content</h3>\n<p>We store the metadata our members provide about a piece of content, not the content itself. Our metadata is openly available across our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/\">APIs</a> and <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">search interfaces</a>. The same applies for access to the full-text. A DOI will take you to a landing page for a piece of content, but access to the full-text will depend upon the content owner’s publishing model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-3-crossref-provides-impact-factors\">Myth #3: Crossref provides impact factors</h3>\n<p>On publisher websites, you’ll sometimes see the number of times a paper has been cited in Crossref, Google Scholar, Web of Science, etc. The Crossref citation information is made available to publishers through our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/\">Cited-by</a> service, but it is not an impact factor. Cited-by counts are based on the subset of Crossref’s members participating in that service, so they’ll probably differ from other sources. Crossref Cited-by counts are meant to complement other services rather than replace them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-4-crossref-charges-to-make-updates-or-corrections-to-the-metadata-associated-with-a-doi\">Myth #4: Crossref charges to make updates or corrections to the metadata associated with a DOI</h3>\n<p>Not true - while you have to pay for your initial registration, any subsequent updates, corrections or additions you make to the metadata of a content item is free of charge (apart from <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/\">Crossmark</a> metadata). If you’re a member, we actively encourage you to update your metadata to ensure that your records are as comprehensive and accurate as possible. This helps the scholarly community find and use the content you publish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-5-crossref-charges-for-failed-deposits\">Myth #5: Crossref charges for failed deposits</h3>\n<p>Only deposits which are successful will be counted. You will receive an error message if your metadata deposit has failed, so you are aware of any errors and can resubmit. If you’re not sure what has gone wrong, you can <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">contact our support team</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-6-you-need-to-have-separate-prefixes-to-register-different-content-types\">Myth #6: You need to have separate prefixes to register different content types</h3>\n<p>You can register all your content types under one prefix (and you don’t need to tell us if you start to do so).</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-7-doi-resolutions-are-how-many-dois-you-have-registered\">Myth #7: DOI resolutions are how many DOIs you have registered</h3>\n<p>No. When someone clicks on a DOI link for an article, we count that as one DOI resolution. This is different than the number of unique DOIs you have registered with us. We’ll send you a <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213197246-Resolution-Report\" target=\"_blank\">resolution report</a> once a month which provides details of your total number of resolutions, as well as DOIs which have been most frequently clicked, and any resolution failures. These failures can be an indication that you need to update your metadata with us for that particular article to ensure your DOI is directing readers to the correct webpage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-8-crossref-own-the-plagiarism-software-used-in-similarity-check\">Myth #8: Crossref own the plagiarism software used in Similarity Check</h3>\n<p>The Similarity Check service is provided in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.turnitin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Turnitin</a> who run the <a href=\"https://www.ithenticate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">iThenticate</a> text-comparison tool. The iThenticate database is the largest comparison database of full-text academic content in the world. Similarity Check participants enjoy cost-effective use of iThenticate because they contribute their own published content into Turnitin’s database. Turnitin also provides our members with access to additional features in iThenticate, such as enhanced text-matches within the document viewer and access to a dedicated Similarity Check support team in order to discuss any technical or billing queries.</p>\n<p>It’s great to have the opportunity to do some myth-busting!

Like that post, this accompanies my talk at <a href=\"https://www.pidapalooza.org\" target=\"_blank\">PIDapalooza</a>, the premier festival of PIDs (Persistent Identifiers). I don&rsquo;t think I need to give a spoiler warning when I tell you that it&rsquo;s still complicated. But this post presents some vocabulary to describe exactly <em>how</em> complicated it is. Event Data has been up and running and collecting data for a couple of years now, but this post describes changes we made toward the end of 2018.</p>\n<p>If Event Data is new to you, you can read about its development in <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/event-data/\">other blog posts</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a>. Today I&rsquo;ll be describing a specific but important part of the machinery: how we match landing pages to DOIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-background\">Some background</h2>\n<p>Our Event Data service provides you with a live database of links to DOIs, found from across the web and social media. Data comes from a variety of places, and most of it is produced by Agents operated by Crossref. We have Agents monitoring Twitter, Wikipedia, Reddit, Stack Overflow, blogs and more besides. It is a sad truth that the good news of DOIs has not reached all corners of world, let alone the dustiest vertices of the world wide web. And even within scholarly publishing and academia, not everyone has heard of DOIs and other persistent identifiers.</p>\n<p>Of course, this means that when we look for links to content-that-has-DOIs, what we at Crossref call &lsquo;registered content&rsquo;, we can&rsquo;t content ourselves with only looking for DOIs. We also have to look for article landing pages. These are the pages you arrive at when you click on a DOI, the page you&rsquo;re on when you decide to share an article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"half-full-or-half-empty\">Half full or half empty?</h2>\n<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to track down links to these landing pages, rather than just DOIs. You could look at this two ways.</p>\n<p>The glass-half-empty view would be that it&rsquo;s a real shame people don&rsquo;t use DOIs. Don&rsquo;t they know that their links aren&rsquo;t future-proof? Don&rsquo;t they know that DOIs allow you to punch the identifier into other services?</p>\n<p>The glass-half-full view is that it&rsquo;s really exciting that people outside the traditional PID crowd are interacting with the literature. We&rsquo;ve been set a challenge to try and track this usage. By collecting this data and processing it into a form that&rsquo;s compatible with other services we can add to its value and better help join the dots in and around the community that we serve. Not everyone tweeting about articles counts as &lsquo;scholarly Twitter&rsquo;, and hopefully we can bridge some divides (the subject of my talk at PIDapalooza last year, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/bridging-identifiers-at-pidapalooza/\">&lsquo;Bridging Identifiers&rsquo;</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-we-do-it\">How do we do it?</h2>\n<p>One of the central tenets of Event Data is transparency. We record as much information as we can about the data we ingest, how we process it, and what we find. Of course, you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to use this data, it&rsquo;s up to you how much depth you want to go into. But it&rsquo;s there if you want it.</p>\n<p>The resulting data set in Event Data is easy to use, but allows you to peek beneath the surface. We do this by linking every Event that our Agents collect through to an Evidence Record. This in turn links to Artifacts, which describe our working data set.</p>\n<p>One such Artifact is the humbly named <code>domain-decision-structure</code>. This is a big tree that records DOI prefixes, domain names, and how they&rsquo;re connected. It includes information such as &ldquo;some DOIs with the prefix <code>10.31139</code> redirect to the domain <code>polishorthopaedics.pl</code>, and we can confirm that pages on that domain correctly represent their DOI&rdquo;. We produce this list by visiting a sample of DOIs from every known prefix. We then ask the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Which webpage does this DOI redirect to, and what domain name does it have?</li>\n<li>Does the webpage include its correct DOI in the HTML metadata?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From this we build the Artifact that records <code>prefix → domain</code> relationships, along with a flag to say whether or not the domain correctly represents its DOI in at least one case. You can put this data to a number of uses, but we use it to help inform our URL to DOI matching.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-do\">What Agents do</h2>\n<p>The Agents use the domain list to search for links. For example, the Reddit Agent uses it to query for new discussions about websites on each domain. They then pass this data to the Percolator, which is the machinery that produces Events.</p>\n<p>The Percolator takes each input, whether it&rsquo;s a blog post or a Tweet, and extracts links. If it finds a DOI link, that&rsquo;s low hanging fruit. It then looks for links to URLs on one of the domains in the list. All of these are considered to be candidate landing page URLs. Once it has found a set of candidate links in the webpage it then has to find which ones correspond to DOIs, and validate that correspondence.</p>\n<p>For each candidate URL it follows the link and retrieves the webpage. It looks in the HTML metadata, specifically in the <code>&lt;meta name='dc.identifier' content='10.5555/12345678' &gt;</code>, to see if the article indicates its DOI. It also looks in the webpage to see if it reports its DOI in the body text.</p>\n<h2 id=\"not-so-fast\">Not so fast</h2>\n<p>But can you trust the web page to indicate its own DOI? What about sites that say that they have a DOI belonging to another member? What about those pages that have invalid or incorrect DOIs? These situations can, and do, occur.</p>\n<p>We have the following methods at our disposal, in order of preference.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>doi-literal</code> - This is the most reliable, and it indicates that the URL we found in the webpage was a DOI not a landing page. We didn&rsquo;t even have to visit the article page.</li>\n<li><code>pii</code> - The input was a PII (Publisher Item Identifier). We used our own metadata to map this into a DOI.</li>\n<li><code>landing-page-url</code> - We thought that the URL was the landing page for an article. Some webpages actually contain the DOI embedded in URL. So we don&rsquo;t even have to visit the page.</li>\n<li><code>landing-page-meta-tag</code> - We had to visit the article landing page. We found a meta tag, eg. <code>dc.identifier</code>, indicating the DOI.</li>\n<li><code>landing-page-page-text</code> - We visited the webpage but there was no meta tag. We did find a DOI in the body text and we think this is the DOI for this page. This is the least reliable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On top of this, we have a number of steps of validation. Again, these are listed in order of preference.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>literal</code> - We found a DOI literal, so we didn&rsquo;t have to do any extra work. This is the most reliable.</li>\n<li><code>lookup</code> - We looked up the PII in our own metadata, and we trust that.</li>\n<li><code>checked-url-exact</code> - We visited the landing page and found a DOI. We visited that DOI and confirmed that it does indeed lead back to this landing page. We are therefore confident that this is the correct DOI for the landing page URL.</li>\n<li><code>checked-url-basic</code> - We visited the DOI and it led back to <em>almost</em> the same URL. The protocol (http vs https), query parameters or upper / lower case may be different. This can happen if tracking parameters are automatically added by the website meaning the URLs are no longer identical. We are still quite confident in the match.</li>\n<li><code>confirmed-domain-prefix</code> - We were unable to check the link between the DOI and the landing page URL, so we had to fall back to previously observed data. On previous occasions we have seen that DOIs with the given prefix (e.g. &ldquo;10.5555&rdquo;) redirect to webpages with the same domain (e.g. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.example.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.example.com</a>&rdquo;) and those websites correctly report their DOIs in meta tags. Only the domain and DOI prefix are considered. We therefore believe that the domain reliably reports its own DOIs correctly in at least some cases.</li>\n<li><code>recognised-domain-prefix</code> - On previous occasions we have seen that DOIs with the given prefix (e.g. &ldquo;10.5555&rdquo;) redirect to webpages with the same domain (e.g. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.example.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.example.com</a>&rdquo;). Those websites do not always correctly report their DOIs in meta tags. This is slightly less reliable.</li>\n<li><code>recognised-domain</code> - On previous occasions we have seen that this domain is associated with DOIs in general. This is the least reliable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We record the method we used to find the DOI, and the way we verified it, right in the Event. Look in the <code>obj.method</code> and <code>obj.verification</code> fields.</p>\n<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a flowchart.</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2019/whats-that-doi/landing-page-flow.png\">\n<p>You can take a closer look in the <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/data/matching-landing-pages/\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>If you think that&rsquo;s a bit long-winded, well, you&rsquo;re right. But it does enable us to capture DOI links without giving a false sense of security.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-happens\">So, what happens?</h2>\n<p>If you <a href=\"http://api.eventdata.crossref.org/v1/events/distinct?from-collected-date=2019-01-01&amp;until-collected-date=2019-01-20&amp;rows=0&amp;facet=obj.url.domain:10\" target=\"_blank\">ask the Event Data Query API</a> for the top ten domains that we matched to DOIs in the first 20 days of January 2019, it would tell you:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Domain</th>\n<th>Number of Events captured</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>doi.org</code></td>\n<td>2058433</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>dx.doi.org</code></td>\n<td>242707</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>www.nature.com</code></td>\n<td>170808</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>adsabs.harvard.edu</code></td>\n<td>163387</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>www.sciencedirect.com</code></td>\n<td>96849</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>onlinelibrary.wiley.com</code></td>\n<td>88760</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>link.springer.com</code></td>\n<td>63869</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>www.tandfonline.com</code></td>\n<td>41911</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>www.sciencemag.org</code></td>\n<td>39489</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>academic.oup.com</code></td>\n<td>39267</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here we see a healthy showing for actual DOIs (which you can explain by Wikipedia&rsquo;s excellent use of DOIs) followed by some of the larger publishers. This demonstrates that we&rsquo;re capturing a healthy number of Events from Wikipedia pages, tweets, blog posts etc that reference landing pages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"awkward-questions\">Awkward questions</h2>\n<p>This is not a perfect process. The whole point of PIDs is to unambiguously identify content. When users don&rsquo;t use PIDs, there will inevitably be imperfections. But because we collect and make available all the processing along the way, hopefully we can go back to the old data, or allow any researchers to try and squeeze more information out of the data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q-why-bother-with-all-of-this-cant-you-just-use-the-urls\">Q: Why bother with all of this? Can&rsquo;t you just use the URLs?</h3>\n<p>We care about persistent identifiers. They are stable identifiers, which means they don&rsquo;t change over time. The same DOI will always refer to the same content. In contrast, publishers&rsquo; landing pages can and do change their URLs over time. If we didn&rsquo;t use the DOIs then our data would suffer from link-rot.</p>\n<p>DOIs are also compatible across different services. You can use the DOI for an article to look it up in metadata and citation databases, and to make connections with other services.</p>\n<p>This is not the only solution to the problem. Other services out there, such as Cobalt Metrics, do record the URLs and store an overlaid data set of identifier mappings. At Crossref we have a specific focus on our members and their content, and we all subscribe to the value of persistent identifiers for their content.</p>\n<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t throw anything away. The URLs are still included in the Events. Look in the <code>obj.url</code> field.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q-if-dois-are-so-amazing-why-keep-urls\">Q: If DOIs are so amazing why keep URLs?</h3>\n<p>Event Data is useful to a really wide range of users. Some will need DOIs to work with the data. But others, who may want to research the stuff under the hood, such as the behaviour of social media users, or the processes we employ, may want to know more detail. So we include it all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q-cant-you-just-decide-for-me\">Q: Can&rsquo;t you just decide for me?</h3>\n<p>In a way, we do. If an Event is included in our data set, we are reasonably confident that it belongs there. All we are doing is providing you with more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q-why-only-dois\">Q: Why only DOIs?</h3>\n<p>We specialise in DOIs and believe they are the right solution for unambiguously and persistently identifying content. Furthermore the content registered with Crossref has been done so for the specific benefits that DOIs bring.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q-what-about-websites-that-require-cookies-andor-javascript-to-execute\">Q: What about websites that require cookies and/or JavaScript to execute?</h3>\n<p>Some sites don&rsquo;t work unless you allow your browser to accept cookies. Some sites don&rsquo;t render any content unless you allow their JavaScript to execute. Large crawlers, like Google, emulate web browsers when they scrape content, but it&rsquo;s resource-intensive and not everyone has the resources of Google!</p>\n<p>This is an issue we&rsquo;ve known about for a while. My talk <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/urls-and-dois-a-complicated-relationship/\">two years ago</a> was about precisely this topic. We know it&rsquo;s a hurdle we&rsquo;ll have to overcome at some point. We do have plans to look into it, but we haven&rsquo;t found a sufficiently cost-effective and reliable way to do it yet.</p>\n<p>Any sites that do do this will be inherently less reliable, so we recommend everyone to put their Dublin Core Identifiers in the HTML, render your HTML server-side (which is the default way of doing things) and don&rsquo;t require cookies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q-whats-the-success-rate\">Q: What&rsquo;s the success rate?</h3>\n<p>This is an interesting question. The results aren&rsquo;t black and white. At the low end of the confidence spectrum we do have a cut-off point, at which we don&rsquo;t generate an Event. But when we do create one we qualify it by describing the method we used to match and verify the connection. What level of confidence you want to trust is for you to decide. We just describe the steps we took to verify it.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s tricky quantifying false negatives. We have plenty of unmatched links, but not every unmatched link even could be matched to a DOI, for example there are some domains that have some DOI-registered content mixed with non-registered content.</p>\n<p>We therefore err on the side of optimism, and let users choose what level of verification they require.</p>\n<p>So talking of false positives or false negatives is a complicated question. We&rsquo;ve not done any analytical work on this yet, but would welcome any input from the community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q-why-isnt-the-domain-decision-structure-artifact-more-detailed\">Q: Why isn&rsquo;t the <code>domain-decision-structure</code> Artifact more detailed?</h3>\n<p>We looked into various ways of constructing this, including more detailed statistics. At the end of the day our processes have to be understandable and easy to re-use. The process already takes a flow-chart to understand, and we felt that we got the balance right. Of course, as a user of this data, you are welcome to further refine and verify it.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Improved processes, and more via Metadata Manager","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/improved-processes-and-more-via-metadata-manager/","published":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Hi, Crossref blog-readers.

I’m <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/shayn-smulyan/\">Shayn</a>, from Crossref’s support team. I’ve been fielding member questions about how to effectively deposit metadata and register content (among other things) for the past three years. In this post, I’ll take you through some of the improvements that Metadata Manager provides to those who currently use the <a href=\"https://apps.crossref.org/webDeposit/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Deposit form</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-manager-members-represent/\">We recently announced the launch of Metadata Manager</a>, a new tool from Crossref that makes it easier for you to submit robust, accurate, and thorough metadata for the content you register. Metadata Manager already covers journals and articles; more content types will be supported soon. It offers some extra features that will make your experience less stressful, make your metadata better, and ultimately make your content more discoverable.</p>\n<p>Metadata Manager has the potential to improve your metadata registration experience in a number of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>by correcting one-off errors in previously registered metadata</li>\n<li>by directly allowing you to add references, license data, funder information, or any other ancillary metadata to items that have previously been registered</li>\n<li>by updating Crossmark data, in the case of a retraction or withdrawal</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"login-first-not-last\">Login first, not last</h2>\n<p>With the Web Deposit form, you finish entering your metadata for a new issue of your journal, and then get asked for your password, and of course that&rsquo;s when you realize you&rsquo;ve forgotten it (it happens a lot!). With <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata Manager</a>, the very first step is to log in, so you know your login credentials are accurate before you get down to the task of entering your metadata.</p>\n<h2 id=\"easily-import-journals-or-add-new-ones\">Easily import journals, or add new ones</h2>\n<p>When you switch to Metadata Manager, you can import the journals already associated with your account. Simply go to the search bar on the Home screen, search for your journal by title, then click ’Add’. If you are registering your first article for a journal that you’ve not registered before, you can add the journal information on the Home screen, by clicking “New Publication”.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/shayn-mm2.png\" alt=\"metadata manager home screen\" width=\"600\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<h2 id=\"adding-a-journal-doi\">Adding a Journal DOI</h2>\n<p>In the Web Deposit form, the Journal DOI is optional, as long as you include a valid ISSN. However, with Metadata Manager, <strong>a Journal DOI must be created for each journal you register</strong>. So, you need to enter a Journal DOI and a Journal URL for each of your journals before your deposits can be submitted. The Journal DOI won’t become active until you submit your first successful deposit for an article within that journal.</p>\n<p>If you’ve never registered a Journal DOI before and are unsure what to use for your Journal DOI’s suffix, take a look at our suggested <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214669823-Constructing-your-identifiers\" target=\"_blank\">best practice for constructing DOI suffixes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adding-new-articles\">Adding new articles</h2>\n<p>Once your journal is added, the process of adding articles in Metadata Manager should be familiar, as it’s similar to the Web Deposit form process. You type in or paste as plain text (without formatting) all your relevant, accurate, and thorough metadata into the appropriate fields in the form.</p>\n<h2 id=\"save-your-work-as-you-go\">Save your work as you go</h2>\n<p>In Metadata Manager there is no need to complete a full issue’s worth of articles at once. And, you don’t need to worry about losing your progress if you accidentally close your browser window, or your laptop runs out of battery while you’re in the middle of a deposit. You can simply and easily ‘save-as-you-go’, one article at a time, until you’re ready to submit them all. You can even review your saved metadata to make sure there aren’t any errors before the deposit is finalized.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-metadata-fields-you-didnt-know-you-needed-but-you-do\">Other metadata fields you didn’t know you needed (but you do!)</h2>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to add an abstract to your content’s metadata? How about license information, so that other organizations know what they can and can’t do with the work? Does your journal use article ID numbers instead of page numbers? These are all elements that can be added to Metadata Manager that were not available in the Web Deposit form. Additionally, you can add funding data, Similarity Check links, and <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214357426-Relationships-between-DOIs-and-other-objects\" target=\"_blank\">relationships between your articles and other content</a>. These types of metadata are hugely valuable for <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-research-nexus-better-research-through-better-metadata/\">building a robust, interconnected web of scholarly communication</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adding-references\">Adding references</h2>\n<p>Unlike the Web Deposit form, Metadata Manager allows you to easily add references to your article’s metadata—this is an important requirement for participating in our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/\">Cited-by</a> service.</p>\n<p>To add references to an article’s metadata, you can copy and paste its reference list into the references field on the same screen as the rest of the article metadata (as per the image below).</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/shayn-mm1.png\" alt=\"metadata manager home screen\" width=\"600\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></center>\n<p>Metadata Manager will match DOIs to those references (where available), and include the full list in your record. So, if you’ve been putting off participating in Cited-by because the reference deposit requirement was too much of a hassle, we hope this will help ease the way! The more references everyone registers, the more robust our Cited-by counts and Cited-by data become.</p>\n<h2 id=\"edit-mistakes-without-having-to-re-enter-all-your-metadata\">Edit mistakes without having to re-enter all your metadata</h2>\n<p>Mistakes happen. Sometimes you put an author’s first name in the last name field. Sometimes you copy and paste some stray HTML tags into your abstract. You might break a link by leaving a space in the middle of a URL, or enter the first-page number as 3170 instead of 317.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With Metadata Manager you can fix any errors quickly and easily right in the interface, then just click to redeposit the article with its metadata corrected. You won’t need to re-enter all the metadata or worry about editing the XML files directly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We’ll have another blog post coming soon that will be devoted entirely to updating, correcting, or otherwise editing metadata for already-registered DOIs in Metadata Manager.</p>\n<h2 id=\"find-out-immediately-if-your-registration-was-successful\">Find out immediately if your registration was successful</h2>\n<p>When you have finished adding the metadata for your articles, navigate to the “To deposit” section and click ‘Deposit’ to submit them. Instead of having to wait for your content to go through our processing queue, you’ll get immediate feedback. The number of Accepted and Failed deposits show immediately. Any articles which have failed are clearly marked with a red triangle icon and an explanation for the error. If you don’t understand an error message or how to correct the metadata, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support@crossref.org</a>.</p>\n<p>To get started with Metadata Manager take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/member-setup/metadata-manager/\">full help documentation</a>.</p>\n<hr>"},{"id":null,"title":"Resolutions 2019: Journal Title Transfers = Metadata Manager","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/resolutions-2019-journal-title-transfers-metadata-manager/","published":"Thu, 03 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000","description":"UPDATE, 12 December 2022 Due to the scheduled sunsetting of Metadata Manager, this title transfer process has been deprecated.

When they finally did arrive the following day, we realized we preferred the rustic look! Some of the merchandise we had prepared ended up sitting in Canadian Customs for a day and a half, which meant they arrived to us halfway through the first day of the event. Luckily attendees were distracted by the very cool ‘I heart metadata’ bags and didn’t seem to notice.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately a significant number of registrants also had problems with Canadian regulations: they were denied visas to enter the country. Despite always trying to choose countries with international airport hubs and a welcoming policy, this was an unforseen blow.</p>\n<p>But from setting up to take down, LIVE18 was truly a team effort. Even though many Crossref staff had traveled far and wide to get there, they all rallied to help the night before—hauling boxes through the streets of Toronto, stuffing attendee bags, hanging signage, and moving furniture around until 11:30 pm.</p>\n<p>Because of these efforts&mdash;and despite the glitches&mdash;Crossref LIVE18 was a great success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-good-is-your-metadata\">How good is your metadata?</h2>\n<p>That was the framing question at Crossref LIVE 18 in Toronto which this year focused on all things metadata.

Now it&rsquo;s time for the matching algorithms to face the real enemy: the <strong>unstructured reference strings</strong> deposited with Crossref by some members. Are the matching algorithms ready for this challenge? Which algorithm will prove worthy of becoming the guardian of the mighty citation network?

The input reference can have a structured form (a collection of metadata fields) and/or an unstructured form (a string formatted in a certain citation style).</p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/matchmaker-matchmaker-make-me-a-match/\">previous blog post</a>, I used reference strings generated automatically to compare four matching algorithms: Crossref&rsquo;s legacy approach based on reference parsing and three variations of search-based matching. The best algorithm turned out to be Search-Based Matching with Validation (SBMV). SBMV uses our <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">REST API&rsquo;s bibliographic search function</a> to select the candidate target documents, and a separate validation-scoring procedure to choose the final target document. The legacy approach and SBMV achieved very similar average precision, and SBMV was much better in average recall.</p>\n<p>This comparison had important limitations, which affect the interpretation of these results.</p>\n<p>First of all, the reference strings in the dataset might be too perfect. Since they were generated automatically from the Crossref metadata records, any piece of information present in the string, such as the title or the name of the author, will exactly match the information in Crossref&rsquo;s metadata. In such a case, a matcher comparing the string against the record can simply apply exact matching and everything should be fine.</p>\n<p>In real life, however, we should expect all sorts of errors and noise in the reference strings. For example, a string might have been manually typed by a human, so it can have typos. The string might have been scraped from the PDF file, in which case it could have unusual unicode characters, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature\" target=\"_blank\">ligatures</a> or missing and extra spaces. A string can also have typical OCR errors, if it was extracted from a scan.</p>\n<p>These problems are typical for messy real-life data, and our matching algorithms should be robust enough to handle them. However, when we evaluate and compare approaches using the perfect reference strings, the results won&rsquo;t tell us how well the algorithms handle harder, noisy cases. After all, even if you repeatedly win chess games against your father, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you will likely defeat Garry Kasparov (unless, of course, you are Garry Kasparov&rsquo;s child, in which case, please pass on our regards to your dad!).</p>\n<p>Even though I attempted to make the data more similar to the noisy real-life data by simulating some of the possible errors (typos, missing/extra spaces) in two styles, this might not be enough. We simply don&rsquo;t know the typical distribution of the errors, or even what all the possible errors are, so our data was probably still far from the real, noisy reference strings.</p>\n<p>The differences in the distributions are a second major issue with the previous experiment. To build the dataset, I used a random sample from Crossref metadata, so the distribution of the cited item types (journal paper, conference proceeding, book chapter, etc.) reflects the overall distribution in our collection. However, the distribution in real life might be different if, for example, journal papers are on average cited more often than conference proceedings.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the distribution of the citation styles is most likely different. To generate the reference strings, I used 11 styles distributed uniformly, while the real distribution most likely contains more styles and is skewed.</p>\n<p>All these issues can be summarized as: <strong>the data used in my previous experiment is different from the data our matching algorithms have to deal with in the production system</strong>. Why is this important? Because in such a case, <strong>the evaluation results do not reflect the real performance in our system</strong>, just like the child&rsquo;s score on the math exam says nothing about their score on the history test. We can hope my previous results accurately showed the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, but the estimations could be far off.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, can we do better? Sure!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This time, instead of automatically-generated reference strings, I will use real reference strings found in the Crossref metadata. This will give us a much better picture of the matching algorithms and their real-life performance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evaluation\">Evaluation</h2>\n<p>This time the <strong>evaluation dataset is composed of 2,000 unstructured reference strings from the Crossref metadata</strong>, along with the target true DOIs. The dataset was prepared mostly manually:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, I drew a random sample of 100,000 metadata records from the system.</li>\n<li>Second, I iterated over all sampled items, and extracted those unstructured reference strings, that do not have the DOI provided by the member.</li>\n<li>Next, I randomly sampled 2,000 reference strings.</li>\n<li>Finally, I assigned a target DOI (or null) to each reference string. This was done by verifying DOIs returned by the algorithms and/or manual searching.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The metrics this time are based on the citation links. A citation link points from the reference (or the document containing the reference) to the referenced (target) document.</p>\n<p>When we apply a matching algorithm to a set of reference strings in our collection, we get a set of citation links between our documents. I will call those citation links <strong>returned links</strong>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, in our collection we have real, <strong>true links</strong> between the documents. In the best-case scenario, the set of true links and the set of returned links are identical. But we don&rsquo;t live in a perfect world and our matching algorithms make mistakes.</p>\n<p>To measure how close the returned links are to the true links, I used precision, recall and F1. This time they are calculated over all citation links in the dataset. More specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Precision</strong> is the fraction of the returned links that are correct. Precision answers the question: if I see a citation link A-&gt;B in the output of a matcher, how certain can I be that paper A actually cites paper B?</li>\n<li><strong>Recall</strong> is the percentage of true links that were returned by the algorithm. Recall answers the question: if paper A cites paper B and B is in the collection, how certain can I be that the matcher&rsquo;s output contains the citation link A-&gt;B?</li>\n<li><strong>F1</strong> is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the previous experiment, I also used precision, recall and F1, but they were calculated for each target document and then averaged. This time precision, recall and F1 are not averaged but simply calculated over all citation links. This is a more natural approach, since now the dataset comprises isolated reference strings rather than target documents, and in practice each target document has at most one incoming reference.</p>\n<p>I tested the same four approaches as before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <strong>legacy approach</strong>, based on reference parsing</li>\n<li><strong>SBM with a simple threshold</strong>, which searches for the reference string in the search engine and returns the first hit, if its relevance score exceeds the predefined threshold</li>\n<li><strong>SBM with a normalized threshold</strong>, which searches for the reference string in the search engine and returns the first hit, if its relevance score divided by the string length exceeds the predefined threshold</li>\n<li><strong>SBMV</strong>, which first applies SBM with a normalized threshold to select a number of candidate items, and a separate validation procedure is used to select the final target item</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the thresholds are parameters which have to be set prior to the matching. The thresholds used in the experiments were chosen using a separate dataset, as the values maximizing the F1 of each algorithm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"results\">Results</h2>\n<p>The plot shows the overall results of all tested approaches:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/matching_comparison_real_data.png\"\nalt=\"overall comparison of reference matching algorithms on real dataset\" width=\"500px\"/>\n</figure>\n<br />\n<p>The exact values are also given in the table (the best result for each metric is bolded):</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>precision</th>\n<th>recall</th>\n<th>F1</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>legacy approach</td>\n<td><strong>0.9895</strong></td>\n<td>0.8685</td>\n<td>0.9251</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SBM (simple threshold)</td>\n<td>0.8686</td>\n<td>0.8191</td>\n<td>0.8431</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SBM (normalized threshold)</td>\n<td>0.7712</td>\n<td>0.9121</td>\n<td>0.8358</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SBMV</td>\n<td>0.9809</td>\n<td><strong>0.9456</strong></td>\n<td><strong>0.9629</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As we can see, the legacy approach is the best in precision, slightly outperforming SBMV. In recall, SBMV is clearly the best, which also decided about its victory over the legacy approach in F1.</p>\n<p>How do these results compare to the results from my previous blog post? The overall trends (the legacy approach slightly outperforms SBMV in precision, and SBMV outperforms the legacy approach in recall and F1) are the same. The most important differences are: 1) on the real dataset SBM without validation is worse than the legacy approach, and 2) this time the algorithms achieved much higher recall. These differences are most likely related to the difference in data distributions explained before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sbmvs-strengths-and-weaknesses\">SBMV&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few example cases where SBMV successfully returned the correct DOI, while the legacy approach failed.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>Lundqvist D, Flykt A, Ohman A: The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces - KDEF, CD ROM from Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Psychology section, Karolinska Institutet. 1998\n</code></pre><p>matched to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/t27732-000\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1037/t27732-000</a></p>\n<p>The target item is a dataset, which means unusual metadata fields and an unusual reference string.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>Schminck, A. , ‘The Beginnings and Origins of the “Macedonian” Dynasty’ in J.

From the perspective of citation links, we have two types of errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>False positives</strong>: incorrect links returned by the algorithm.</li>\n<li><strong>False negatives</strong>: links that should have been returned but weren&rsquo;t.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we apply SBMV instead of the legacy approach, the fraction of false positives within the returned links increases from 1.05% to 1.91%, and the fraction of false negatives within the true links decreases from 13.15% to 5.44%. This means with SBMV:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.91% of the links in the algorithm&rsquo;s output are incorrect</li>\n<li>5.44% of the true links are not returned by the algorithm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also classify all the references in the dataset into several categories, based on the values of true and returned DOIs:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/matching_references_errors.png\"\nalt=\"references errors distribution\" width=\"800px\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>We have the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>References matched to correct DOIs (1129 cases, returned and true blue)</li>\n<li>References correctly not matched to anything (791 cases, returned and true white)</li>\n<li>References not matched to anything, when they should be (58 cases, returned white, true grey)</li>\n<li>References matched to wrong DOIs (7 cases, returned red, true yellow)</li>\n<li>References matched to something, when they shouldn&rsquo;t be matched to anything (15 cases, returned black, true white)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that in terms of these categories, precision is equal to:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/matching_precision.png\"\nalt=\"precision\" width=\"200px\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>And recall is equal to:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/matching_recall.png\"\nalt=\"recall\" width=\"200px\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>What are the most common causes of SBMV&rsquo;s errors?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incomplete or incorrect Crossref metadata. Even a perfect reference string formatted in the most popular citation style will not be matched, if the target record in the Crossref collection has many missing or incorrect fields.</li>\n<li>Similarly, missing or incorrect information in the reference string is very problematic for the matchers.</li>\n<li>Errors/noise in the reference string, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>HTML/XML markup not stripped from the string</li>\n<li>multiple references mixed in one string</li>\n<li>spacing issues and typos</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In a few cases a document related to the real target was matched, such as the book instead of its chapter, or the conference proceedings paper instead of the thesis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h2>\n<p>The most important limitation is the size of the dataset. Every item had to be verified manually, which significantly limited the possibility of creating a large set and also using a lot of independent sets.</p>\n<p>Finally, the numbers reported here still don&rsquo;t reflect the overall precision and recall of the current links in the Crossref metadata. This is because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we still use the legacy approach for matching,</li>\n<li>some references are deposited along with the target DOIs and are not matched by Crossref, these links are not analyzed here, and</li>\n<li>in Crossref we have both unstructured and structured references, and in this experiment only the unstructured ones were tested.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>\n<p>The next experiment will be related to the structured references. Similarly as here, I will try to estimate the performance of the search-based matching approach and compare it to the performance of the legacy approach.</p>\n<p>The evaluation framework, evaluation data and experiments related to the reference matching are available in the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/reference-matching-evaluation\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/CrossRef/reference-matching-evaluation</a>.

To be honest, there were some things we didn’t get done—or didn’t make as much progress with as we hoped—but that happens when you have an ambitious agenda. However, we also got some things done that we didn’t expect to or that weren’t even on our radar at the end of 2017—this is inevitable as the research and scholarly communications landscape is rapidly changing.</p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-year-in-the-life-of-crossref/\">blog post</a> from the beginning of the year, the key projects I highlighted were <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/\">Metadata Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/\">Event Data</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/org-id-a-recap-and-a-hint-of-things-to-come/\">Organization IDs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/global-persistent-identifiers-for-grants-awards-and-facilities/\">Grant IDs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.metadata2020.org\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata 2020</a>, and that richer metadata and more content types were key goals. We did make very good progress on all of these projects as reported below.</p>\n<p>For 2018 we were operating in the framework of the four strategic themes, or areas of focus, developed by the board and staff. These are: 1) Simplifying and enriching our services; 2) Improving our metadata; 3) Expanding constituencies, and 4) Selectively collaborating and partnering. These themes will also be guiding us in 2019.</p>\n<h2 id=\"simplifying-and-enriching-our-services\">Simplifying and enriching our services</h2>\n<h3 id=\"upgrading-our-tools\">Upgrading our tools</h3>\n<p>Over the past year, we’ve been busy streamlining our processes, developing new tools and adding new services. A key new tool is <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata Manager</a> which supports the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/\">Content Registration service</a> by offering a simpler, more user-friendly, non-technical way to register and update metadata. It provides lots of context-sensitive help, registers content immediately, in real time, and provides guidance on how to make corrections—thereby ensuring each deposit is successful. Metadata Manager currently supports journal deposits (we would have liked to add more in 2018) but we will be adding other content types on 2019.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upgrading-our-services\">Upgrading our services</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/\">Crossref metadata</a> has always been open through a number of interfaces without restriction, but this year we introduced an option for extra support and functionality, through <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/\">Metadata Plus</a>. Metadata Plus provides guaranteed uptime, snapshots of the complete set of metadata and enhanced support for organizations (members or not) that want to use Crossref metadata in their own services and systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improving-the-member-experience-new-membership-terms\">Improving the member experience: New membership terms</h3>\n<p>This year we began to redesign the member experience and have made a lot of improvements to the sign-up and onboarding process, the most significant of which is the new click-through membership terms, introduced in July for new members and coming into effect for existing members in March 2019, which is proving to be a huge time saver for both our members and our team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"improving-our-metadata\">Improving our metadata</h2>\n<p>Our objective this year was to better communicate what metadata best practice is, to equip our members with all the data and tools they need to meet this best practice, and to achieve closer cooperation from service providers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"best-practice-tools-participation-reports\">Best practice tools: Participation Reports</h3>\n<p>Released in Beta in August this year, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">Participation Reports</a> provides a dashboard that gives a clear picture of the metadata that each member provides. This is a useful visualization of metadata that has long been available via our public REST API. Members can see where the gaps in the metadata are and get information on how to fill those gaps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"communicating-metadata-best-practice-data-citations\">Communicating metadata best practice: Data Citations</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/why-data-citation-matters-to-publishers-and-data-repositories/\">The importance of linking data</a> with literature can’t be understated. Research integrity and reproducibility depend on it. We&rsquo;re committed to exposing the links between the literature and the data or software that supports it, and earlier this year we partnered with <a href=\"https://www.datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite</a> to make this a reality. All the data citations coming in from Crossref and DataCite are being pulled into Event Data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"equipping-members-with-all-the-data-event-data\">Equipping members with all the data: Event Data</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/\">Event Data</a> reached technical readiness. Event Data captures and records “events” such as comments, links, shares, bookmarks, and references. It provides open, transparent, and traceable information about the provenance and context of every event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"expand-constituencies\">Expand constituencies</h2>\n<p>Crossref currently has 15,000 members in 140 countries. With that comes the need to increasingly and proactively work with emerging markets as they start to share research outputs globally.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambassador-program\">Ambassador program</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/ambassadors/\">The Crossref Ambassador program</a> launched in January and now has a team of 16 trusted contacts who work within our communities (as librarians, researchers, publishers, and innovators) around the world. They share great enthusiasm and belief in our work. We provide them with training and support, and they help us improve education about global research infrastructure in general and the opportunities that are enabled through richer metadata.</p>\n<h3 id=\"funders-and-grant-identifiers\">Funders and grant identifiers</h3>\n<p>I’m very happy to report that the Crossref board approved grants as a new content type to be rolled out in 2019 - we made faster progress on this than expected. The proposal for grant identifiers was developed by staff in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders/\">Crossref Funder Advisory Group</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/\">Membership and Fees Committee</a>. This means that funders will be joining Crossref and registering a standard set of metadata and a persistence identifier - a DOI - for their grants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"collaborate-and-partner\">Collaborate and partner</h2>\n<p>So that our alliances with others have the greatest impact, we have aligned our strategic plans for scholarly infrastructure with others. Some of these alliances are led or driven by Crossref and with others we are involved but not leading.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ror\">ROR</h3>\n<p>We are working with the <a href=\"https://www.cdlib.org/\" target=\"_blank\">California Digital Library</a>, <a href=\"https://www.datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digital-science.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Science</a> as the Steering group for <a href=\"https://ror.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ROR</a> - the Research Organization Registry - which is a new, community-led project that is developing an open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifier for research organizations based on the work done by the <a href=\"https://orcid.org/content/organization-identifier-working-group\" target=\"_blank\">Organization Identifier Working Group</a> in 2017 and 2018.</p>\n<h3 id=\"metadata-2020\">Metadata 2020</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.metadata2020.org\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata 2020</a> is a collaboration that advocates richer, connected, and reusable, open metadata for all research outputs, which will advance scholarly pursuits for the benefit of society. Over 140 volunteers—including publishers, librarians, researchers, platforms/tools, and other stakeholders—from 86 organizations, are working in six project groups. The projects are very strategically focused, looking at key issues like researcher communications, incentives, and shared best practices.</p>\n<p>I can’t close off the year without mentioning the incredible milestone we reached this September when <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/100000000-records-thank-you/\">the 100th million content item was registered</a> with Crossref.

The new terms come into effect on 1st March 2019 for existing members and no action is needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you&rsquo;re a <strong>sponsored member</strong> you&rsquo;ll have a slightly adapted message soon as we work with your sponsor.</li>\n<li>If you&rsquo;re an NGO or US State Actor you will receive a slightly adapted message.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"shortcode-divwrap blue-highlight\">\n<span>This post is for background explanation and information. We will email existing members directly, but no acceptance or signature&mdash;nor any action&mdash;will be needed.</span>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"why-are-we-updating-the-terms\">Why are we updating the terms?</h2>\n<p>Being almost 20 years old the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/2018-agreement\">old agreement</a> is out-of-date with current practice and technology, and has become quite long and confusing, especially for applicants for whom English is not their first language. Specific reasons include:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-to-improve-efficiency\">1. To improve efficiency</h3>\n<p>Over the years we’ve had feedback that our application process is too long and involved. The membership agreement used to be signed manually by each new Crossref member, often days after they applied. We also now process around 180 new members each month which is too many for a wholly manual process managed by just one person.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-to-clarify-the-wording\">2. To clarify the wording</h3>\n<p>People would tell us that the agreement is too long and confusing, especially when English is not their first language. There are often questions about the “legalese” style of language that takes up too much time in back-and-forth discussions to ensure everyone has understood. Also, the main structure of the agreement has been in place for over a decade and needs updating to avoid confusion and to align with up-to-date language, services, technologies, and current practices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-to-emphasize-the-community-aspect-and-our-members-obligations\">3. To emphasize the community aspect and our members’ obligations</h3>\n<p>It is quite a commitment to participate fully in Crossref, and we want people to understand up-front what their obligations are as part of the collective membership. And also to realize what value they are receiving as well as contributing to other members. We needed clearer terms so that every organization can understand what they are getting into.</p>\n<p>Additionally, moving from signing contracts to click-through acceptance of standard terms emphasizes that Crossref is not a service provider or vendor. We are a not-for-profit community organization. We don’t have the resources to negotiate and keep track of individual custom agreements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-changing-step-by-step\">What’s changing, step-by-step</h2>\n<p>We consulted with former and current legal counsel, the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees\">Membership &amp; Fees Committee</a>, and also with the M&amp;F organizations individually. We have also absorbed a lot of feedback from many other members of all kinds and sizes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-new-members\">For new members</h3>\n<p>The manually-signed membership agreement has already&mdash;for new members&mdash; been turned into a set of click-through terms that organizations agree to as part of the initial application process. It is no longer a separate document that needs to be signed or countersigned. This will simplify the application process for both new applicants and our staff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-existing-members\">For existing members</h3>\n<p>The new membership terms will come into effect for existing members on March 1st, 2019. Because this is a material change to the terms, we will be emailing members with more information but it’s important to note that no action is necessary from existing members. The new terms will replace the old terms automatically.</p>\n<p>The table below sets out clause-by-clause the precise changes.

At the November 2017 meeting there was a motion passed to create an ad-hoc Governance Committee to develop a set of governance-related questions/recommendations. The Committee has met regularly this year and the following questions are under deliberation regarding term limits, role of the Nominating Committee, implications of contested elections, and more.</p>\n<p>The full motion to create the committee is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ad hoc Governance Committee should discuss and make specific recommendations (including where necessary proposing appropriate by-law amendments) about (i) the timing of the annual election of members and whether the newly elected Board can take office a fixed period after the election results are finalized; (ii) the role and responsibilities of the Nominating Committee and its relationship to the Board; (iii) the implications of having contested Board elections; (iv) the election of officers, Executive Committee members, and committee chairs, and v) options and required changes for board members to represent specific constituencies (e.g. based on membership types).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Governance Committee members are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paul Peters (Hindawi and Board Chair)</li>\n<li>Scott Delman (ACM and Board Treasurer)</li>\n<li>Chris Shillum (Elsevier and Executive Committee member)</li>\n<li>Mark Patterson (eLife)</li>\n<li>Ed Pentz (Crossref Executive Director)</li>\n<li>Lisa Hart (Crossref Finance &amp; Operations Director)</li>\n<li>Emily Cooke (Pierce Atwood, legal counsel).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The committee’s goal was to try to maintain and increase transparency; consider practicality and impact of any changes and ensure continuity and balance.</p>\n<p>At the March meeting the committee provided an overview of the issues they had discussed. There was consensus to accept the committee’s recommendation to address all of the governance matters comprehensively at the July 2018 meeting.</p>\n<p>Discussions resulted in two changes to our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/bylaws/\">by-laws</a>:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-membership-eligibility\">1. Membership eligibility</h2>\n<p>To provide clarity around membership qualification, we resolved to amend Article I Section 1 by replacing the text in its entirety with the following text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Membership in Crossref shall be open to any organization that publishes professional and scholarly materials and content and otherwise meets the terms and conditions of membership established from time to time by the Board of Directors, and to such other entities as the Board of Directors shall determine from time to time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"2-start-date-of-board-terms\">2. Start date of board terms</h2>\n<p>We also resolved to amend Article V Section 4 to replace the phrase “on the day after” with the phrase “during the next calendar quarter immediately following”. This allows the Board to meet directly ahead of Crossref’s Annual Meeting and Board election (from 2019) instead of directly after.</p>\n<p>The first change captures the fact that we have a very broad community beyond what is seen as traditional publishers, who themselves do not solely identify as publishers anymore. It reflects how our membership has evolved, and also includes organizations that publish that aren’t publishers (universities, government agencies, etc.)</p>\n<p>The second change was a practical one. As Crossref had its first contested election in 2017, and in 2018 as well, it seemed unreasonable to have a brand new Board meet the day after the election, especially when there is potential for officers to not be re-elected. The old by-laws were very specific about holding the Board meeting the day after the election. With this change, starting with the March meeting, the new Board will have a full calendar year of meetings, which seems more practical, and we will establish a process for the election of officers.</p>\n<p>During that meeting we deliberated the following questions/recommendations raised by the committee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development of a policy on canvassing/campaigning by candidates in Board elections;</li>\n<li>Development of policies on nominations to the positions of Chair, Treasurer, Executive Committee members, the Nominating Committee Chair, and the Audit Committee Chair;</li>\n<li>Analysis of how best to achieve balance and representation on the Board going forward (designated seats and/or a binding Board remit to the Nominating Committee);</li>\n<li>Analysis as to whether to impose term limits on board members;</li>\n<li>Analysis as to how best to handle independent nominations to the Board (eliminate the option, or improve the process); and</li>\n<li>Review of our governing documents’ provisions on vacancies, to confirm that the Board follows the required steps on the filling of vacancies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the November 2018 Board meeting&mdash;following Crossref LIVE18&mdash;there were two more amendments to the bylaws:</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-removal-of-independant-nominations\">3. Removal of independant nominations</h2>\n<p>To remove Art. V II Sec. 3 on independent nominations. This change reflects the consensus that there is no need for independent nominations with the introduction of contested elections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-membership-start-date-of-record\">4. Membership start date of record</h2>\n<p>To amend Art. I Sec. 2 to amend language dealing with record date of membership. This is a practical change following the July 2018 introduction of <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/terms\">new membership terms</a> which are click-through online terms and don&rsquo;t need counter-signatures.</p>\n<p>The new Board will resume the discussion on designated seats at our March 2019 meeting.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Data Citation: what and how for publishers","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/data-citation-what-and-how-for-publishers/","published":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"We’ve mentioned why data citation is important to the research community.

This roadmap is the outcome of a collaboration between different publishers that worked on identifying all steps you need to take as a publisher to implement data citation. If you want to know more about establishing a data policy, capturing data citations at the point of submission, or tagging data citations in your XML, we recommend you take a look at this article!</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we’ll discuss the steps you need to take after you’ve implemented this roadmap. The steps in the roadmap describe how you can track &amp; tag data citation yourself. Here we describe how Crossref can help you make these available to the rest of the community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-what\">The &lsquo;what&rsquo;</h2>\n<p>Here’s the recap! From the Crossref perspective, there are two ways to add data citation links into the metadata that you register:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-metadata-deposits-using-the-references-section-of-the-schema\">1. Metadata deposits using the references section of the schema</h3>\n<p>This is where ‘citations’ are normally recorded. Publishers include the data citation into the deposit of bibliographic references for each publication.</p>\n<p>Publishers can deposit the full data or software citation as a unstructured reference.

To tag the data &amp; software citation in the metadata deposit, we ask for the description of the dataset &amp; software (optional), dataset &amp; software identifier and identifier type (DOI, PMID, PMCID, PURL, ARK, Handle, UUID, ECLI, and URI), and <a href=\"http://data.crossref.org/reports/help/schema_doc/4.3.5/NO_NAMESPACE.html#inter_work_relation_relationship-type\" target=\"_blank\">relationship type</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-XML\" data-lang=\"XML\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;program</span> <span class=\"na\">xmlns=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;http://www.crossref.org/relations.xsd&#34;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;related_item&gt;</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;description&gt;</span>Data from: Extreme genetic structure in a social bird species despite high dispersal capacity<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/description&gt;</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;inter_work_relation</span> <span class=\"na\">relationship-type=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;references&#34;</span> <span class=\"na\">identifier-type=</span><span class=\"s\">&#34;doi&#34;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>10.5061/dryad.684v0<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/inter_work_relation&gt;</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/related_item&gt;</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/program&gt;</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/doi_relations&gt;</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><br>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In general, use the relation type <code>references</code> for data and software resources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Publishers who wish to specify that the data or software resource was generated as part of the research results can use the <code>isSupplementedBy</code> relation type.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-how\">The &lsquo;how&rsquo;</h2>\n<h3 id=\"i-create-my-own-xml-and-register-it-with-crossref\">I create my own XML and register it with Crossref</h3>\n<p>Add links to datasets into your reference lists, including their DOIs if available as shown above and deposit them with Crossref. We’ll do the rest. If you want to add references to existing metadata records, you don’t need to redeposit the full article metadata, you can send us a <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/215578403\" target=\"_blank\">resource-only deposit</a> that just contains the reference metadata to append that to the existing metadata for the article. You can also use this method if you prefer to deposit references in a separate workflow to registering your content (we know some members prefer to work this way).</p>\n<h3 id=\"ive-started-using-metadata-manager-for-journal-article-deposits\">I’ve started using Metadata Manager for journal article deposits</h3>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/dc.png\"\nalt=\"Article&lt;-&gt;Data relationships in Crossref\" width=\"350\"/><figcaption>\n<p>Article&lt;-&gt;Data relationships in Crossref</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>You can deposit data citations using either method using our new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/member-setup/metadata-manager/\">Metadata Manager</a> tool. When entering journal article metadata, you can use the ‘Related Items’ section to enter the DOI (or other identifier) for the dataset, the type of identifier, a description of the relation type e.g. &lsquo;Data from: Extreme genetic structure in a social bird species despite high dispersal capacity’, and the relation type - ‘references’ or ‘is supplemented by’ depending on the relationship between the data and the article as described above. When you make the deposit, this relationship information will be registered in Crossref along with the rest of the article metadata.</p>\n<p>Metadata Manager also has a section where you can enter and match your references, and then deposit these with Crossref. If you choose this method, enter any data citations into the references section before depositing the article metadata with Crossref.</p>\n<p>If you want to add this information to deposits you have already made using Metadata Manager, you can search for the journals and articles in the interface, bring up the existing metadata and add in the additional information before redepositing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-use-simple-text-query-to-search-for-and-deposit-references\">I use &ldquo;simple text query&rdquo; to search for and deposit references</h3>\n<p>Make sure you include any citations to data in the references you add into Simple Text Query.

A typical meta-approach to reference matching might be to score the similarity between the input reference and the candidate target documents. The document most similar to the input is then returned as the target.</p>\n<p>Of course, still a lot can go wrong here. We can have more than one potential target record with the same score (which one do we choose?). We can have only documents with low to medium scores (is the actual target even present in our collection?). We can also have errors in the input string (are the similarity scores robust enough?). Life&rsquo;s tough!</p>\n<p>The main difference between various matching algorithms is in fact how the similarity is calculated. For example, one idea might be to compare the records field by field (how similar is the title/author/journal in the input reference to the title/author/journal of our candidate target record?). This is roughly how the matching works currently at Crossref.</p>\n<p>The main problem with this approach is that it requires a structured reference, and in practise, often all we have is a plain reference string. In such a case we need to extract the metadata fields from the reference string (this is called parsing). Parsing introduces errors, since no parser is omniscient. The errors propagate further and affect the scoring… you get the picture.</p>\n<p>Luckily, as <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/labs/resolving-citations-we-dont-need-no-stinkin-parser/\">we have known for some time now</a>, this is not the only approach. Instead of comparing structured objects, we could calculate the similarity between them using their unstructured textual form. This effectively eliminates the need for parsing, since the unstructured form is either already available on the input or can be easily generated from the structured form.</p>\n<p>What about the similarity scores? We already know a powerful method for scoring the similarities between texts. Those are (you guessed it!) scoring algorithms used by search engines. Most of them, including <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref&rsquo;s</a>, do not need a structured representation of the object, they are perfectly happy with just a plain text query.</p>\n<p>So all we need to do is to pass the original reference string (or some concatenation of the reference fields, if only a structured reference is available) to the search engine and let it score the similarity for us. It will also conveniently sort the results so that it is easy to find the top hit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evaluation\">Evaluation</h3>\n<p>So far so good. But which strategy is better? Is it better to develop an accurate parser, or just rely on the search engine? I don&rsquo;t feel like guessing. Let&rsquo;s try to answer this using (data) science. But first, we need to decompose our question into smaller pieces.</p>\n<h4 id=\"question-1-how-can-i-measure-the-quality-of-a-reference-matcher\">Question 1. How can I measure the quality of a reference matcher?</h4>\n<p>Generally speaking, this can be done by checking the resulting citation links. Simply put, the better the links, the better the matching approach must have been.</p>\n<p>A few standard metrics can be applied here, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision\" target=\"_blank\">accuracy</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall\" target=\"_blank\">precision, recall</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score\" target=\"_blank\">F1</a>. We decided to calculate precision, recall and F1 separately for each document in the dataset, and then average those numbers over the entire dataset.</p>\n<p>When I say &ldquo;documents&rdquo;, I really mean &ldquo;target documents&rdquo;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>precision</strong> for a document X tells us, what percentage of links to X in the system are correct</li>\n<li><strong>recall</strong> for a document X tells us, what percentage of true links to X are present in the system</li>\n<li><strong>F1</strong> is the harmonic mean of precision and recall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>F1 is a single-number metric combining precision and recall. In F1 precision and recall are weighted equally. It is also possible to combine precision and recall using different weights, to place more emphasis on one of those metrics.</p>\n<p>We decided to look at links from the target document&rsquo;s perspective, because this is what the academic world cares about (i.e. how accurate the citation counts of academic papers are).</p>\n<p>Calculating separate numbers for individual documents and averaging them within a dataset is the best way to have reliable confidence intervals (which makes the whole analysis look much smarter!).</p>\n<h4 id=\"question-2-which-approaches-should-be-compared\">Question 2. Which approaches should be compared?</h4>\n<p>In total we tested four reference matching approaches.</p>\n<p>The first approach, called the <strong>legacy approach</strong>, is the approach currently used in Crossref ecosystem. It uses a parser and matches the extracted metadata fields against the records in the collection.</p>\n<p>The second approach is the <strong>search-based matching (SBM)</strong> with a <strong>simple threshold</strong>. It queries the search engine using the reference string and returns the top hit from the results, if its relevance score exceeds the threshold.</p>\n<p>The third approach is the <strong>search-based matching (SBM)</strong> with a <strong>normalized threshold</strong>. Similarly as in the simplest SBM, in this approach we query the search engine using the reference string. In this case the first hit is returned if its normalized score (the score divided by the reference length) exceeds the threshold.</p>\n<p>Finally, the fourth approach is a variation of the search based matching, called <strong>search-based matching with validation (SBMV)</strong>. In this algorithm we use additional validation procedure on top of SBM. First, SBM with a normalized threshold is applied and the search results with the scores exceeding the normalized threshold are selected as candidate target documents. Second, we calculate validation similarity between the input string and each of the candidates. This validation similarity is based on the presence of the candidate record&rsquo;s metadata fields (year, volume, issue, pages, the last name of the first author, etc.) in the input reference string, as well as the relevance score returned by the search engine. Finally, the most similar candidate is returned as the final target document, if its validation similarity exceeds the <strong>validation threshold</strong>.</p>\n<p>By adding the validation stage to the search-based matching we make sure that the same bibliographic numbers (year, volume, etc.) are present in both the input reference and the returned document. We also don&rsquo;t simply take the first result, but rather use this validation similarity to choose from results scored similarly by the search engine.</p>\n<p>All the thresholds are parameters which have to be set prior to the matching. The thresholds used in these experiments were chosen using a separate dataset, as the values maximizing the F1 of each algorithm.</p>\n<h4 id=\"question-3-how-to-create-the-dataset\">Question 3. How to create the dataset?</h4>\n<h3 id=\"results\">Results</h3>\n<p>We could try to calculate our metrics for every single document in the system. Since we currently have <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/100000000-records-thank-you/\">over 100M of them</a>, this would take a while, and we already felt impatient&hellip;</p>\n<p>A faster strategy was to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28statistics%29\" target=\"_blank\">sampling</a> with all the tools statistics was so generous to provide. And this is exactly what we did. We used a random sample of 2500 items from our system, which is big enough to give reliable results and, as we will see later, produces quite narrow confidence intervals.</p>\n<p>Apart from the sample, we needed some input reference strings. We generated those automatically by formatting the metadata of the chosen items using various citation styles. (Similarly to what happens when you automatically format the bibliography section for your article. Or at least we hope you don&rsquo;t produce those reference strings manually…)</p>\n<p>For each record in our sample, we generated 11 citation strings, using the following styles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Well known citation styles from various disciplines:\n<ul>\n<li>american-chemical-society (acs)</li>\n<li>american-institute-of-physics (aip)</li>\n<li>elsevier-without-titles (ewt)</li>\n<li>apa</li>\n<li>chicago-author-date</li>\n<li>modern-language-association (mla)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Known styles + random noise. To simulate not-so-clean data, we randomly added noise (additional spaces, deleted spaces, typos) to the generated strings of the following styles:\n<ul>\n<li>american-institute-of-physics</li>\n<li>apa</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Custom degraded &ldquo;styles&rdquo;:\n<ul>\n<li>degraded: a simple concatenation of authors&rsquo; names, title, container title, year, volume, issue and pages</li>\n<li>one author: a simple concatenation of the first author&rsquo;s name, title, container title, year, volume, issue and pages</li>\n<li>title scrambled: same as degraded, but with title words randomly shuffled</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some styles include the DOI in the reference string. In such cases we stripped the DOI from the string, to make the matching problem non-trivial.</p>\n<p>An ideal matching algorithm will match every generated string to the record it was generated from. In practise, some of the expected matches will be missing, which will lower the recall of the tested matching approach. On the other hand, it is very probable that we will get the precision of 100%. To have the precision lower than 100%, we would have to have some unexpected matches to our sampled documents, which is unlikely. This is obviously not great, because we are missing a very important piece of information.</p>\n<p>What can we do to “encourage” such mismatches to our sampled documents? We could generate additional reference strings of documents that are not in our sample, but are similar to the documents in our sample. Hopefully, we will see some incorrect links from those similar strings to our sampled documents.</p>\n<p>For each sampled document I added up to 2 similar documents (I used, surprise surprise, our search engine to find the most similar documents). I ended up with 7,374 items in total (2,500 originally sampled and 4,874 similar items). For each item, 11 different reference strings were generated. Each reference string was then matched using the tested approaches and I could finally look at some results.</p>\n<h3 id=\"results-1\">Results</h3>\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s compare the overall results averaged over the entire dataset:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/matching_comparison_overall.png\" alt=\"overall comparison of reference matching evaluation\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>The small vertical black lines at the top of the boxes show the confidence intervals at the confidence level 95%.

For example, we are 95% sure that the real F1 for SBMV in our entire collection is within the range 0.8352 - 0.8544.</p>\n<p>As we can see, each metric has a different winner.</p>\n<p><strong>The legacy approach is the best in precision</strong>. This suggests the legacy approach is quite conservative and outputs a match only if it is very sure about it. This might also result in missing a number of true matches (false negatives).</p>\n<p>According to the paired Student&rsquo;s t-test, the difference between the average precision of the legacy approach and the average precision of the second best SBMV is not statistically significant. This means we cannot rule out that this difference is simply the effect of the randomness in sampling, and not the sign of the true difference.</p>\n<p><strong>SBM with a normalized threshold is the best in recall</strong>. This suggests that it is fairly tolerant and returns a lot of matches, which might also result in returning more incorrect matches (false positives). Also in this case the difference between the winner and the second best (SBMV) is not statistically significant.</p>\n<p><strong>SBMV is the best in F1</strong>. This shows that this approach balances precision and recall the best, despite being only the second best in both of those metrics. According to the paired Student&rsquo;s t-test, the difference between SBMV and the second best approach (SBM with a normalized threshold) is <strong>statistically significant</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>All variants of the search-based matching outperform the parsing-based approach in terms of F1</strong>, with statistically significant differences. This shows that in search based-matching it is possible to keep precision almost as good as in the legacy approach, and still include many more true positives.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s also look at the same results split by the citation style:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/matching_comparison_by_style.png\" alt=\"comparison of reference matching evaluation by style\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>For all styles the precision values are very high, and the legacy approach is slightly better than all variations of the search-based approach.</p>\n<p>In terms of recall and F1 SBM with a simple threshold is better than the legacy approach in 8 out of 11 styles. The three styles for which the legacy approach outperforms SBM with a simple threshold are styles that do not include the title in the reference strings (acs, aip and ewt). The reason for this is that the simple threshold cannot be well calibrated for shorter and longer reference strings at the same time.</p>\n<p>SBM with a normalized threshold and <strong>SBMV is better than the legacy approach in recall and F1 for all 11 styles</strong>.</p>\n<p>The weak spot of the legacy approach is degraded and noisy reference strings, which do not appear to use any of the known citation styles.</p>\n<p>The weak spot of the search-based matching is short reference strings, and in particular citation styles that do not include the title in the string.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h3>\n<p>The limitations are related mostly to the method of building the dataset.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the numbers reported here are estimates, since they were calculated on a sample.</li>\n<li>The numbers show strengths and weaknesses of each approach, but they do not reflect the real precision and recall in the system:\n<ul>\n<li>Since we included only 2 similar documents for each document in the sample, precision is most likely lower in the real data.</li>\n<li>We used a number of styles distributed uniformly.

Hmm, still not sure, you&rsquo;ve eaten such a small fraction of the soup, who can guarantee the rest tastes the same? You have no choice but to eat another bowl, and then some more… Ooops, now you have eaten the entire pot of soup! At least you can be 100% sure now that the soup was indeed salty enough.

In Crossref&rsquo;s case, reference matching is the task of finding the target document DOI for the given input reference string, such as:</p>\n<p><em>(1) Adamo, S. H.; Cain, M. S.; Mitroff, S. R. Psychological Science 2013, 24, 2569–2574.</em></p>\n<p>Accurate reference matching is very important for the scientific community. Thanks to automatic reference matching we are able to find citing relations in large document sets, calculate citation counts, H-indexes, impact factors, etc.</p>\n<p>For several weeks now I have been investigating <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/labs/resolving-citations-we-dont-need-no-stinkin-parser/\">a simple reference matching algorithm based on the search engine</a>. In this algorithm, we use the input reference string as the query in the search engine, and we return the first item from the results as the target document. Luckily, at Crossref we already have <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">a good search engine</a> in place, so all the pieces are there.</p>\n<p>I was interested in how well this simple algorithm works, i.e. how often the correct target document is found. For example, let&rsquo;s say we have a reference string in APA citation style generated for a specific record in Crossref system. How certain can I be that it will be correctly matched to the record&rsquo;s DOI?</p>\n<p>I could calculate this directly by generating the APA reference string for every record in the system and trying to match those strings to DOIs. Since we already have <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/100000000-records-thank-you/\">over 100M records</a>, this would take a while and I was getting impatient. So instead of eating the whole pot of soup, I decided to stir and taste just a little bit of it, or, academically speaking, use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28statistics%29\" target=\"_blank\">sampling</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval\" target=\"_blank\">confidence intervals</a>.</p>\n<p>These statistical tools are useful in situations, where we have a large set of items, and we want to know the average of a certain feature of an item in our set, or the proportion of items passing a certain test, but calculating it directly is impossible or difficult. For example, we might want to know the average height of all women living in USA, the average salary of a Java programmer in London, or the proportion of book records in the Crossref collection. The entire set we are interested in is called a <strong>population</strong> and the value we are interested in is called a <strong>population average</strong> or a <strong>population proportion</strong>. Sampling and confidence intervals let us estimate the population average or proportion using only a sample of items, in a reliable and controlled way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"experiments\">Experiments</h3>\n<p>In general I wanted to see, how well I can estimate the population proportion of records passing a certain test, using only a sample.</p>\n<p>In the following experiments, the population is 1 million metadata records from the Crossref collection. I didn&rsquo;t use the entire collection as the population, because I wanted to be able to calculate the real proportion and compare it to the estimates.</p>\n<p>The test for a single record is: whether the APA reference string generated from said record is correctly matched to the record&rsquo;s original DOI. In other words: if I generate the APA reference string from my record and use it as the query in Crossref&rsquo;s search, will the record be the first element in the result list? Note that this proportion can also be interpreted as the probability that the APA reference string will be correctly matched to the target DOI.</p>\n<h4 id=\"estimating-from-a-sample\">Estimating from a sample</h4>\n<p>I took a random sample of size 100 from my population and calculated the proportion of the records correctly matched - this is called a <strong>sample proportion</strong>. In my case, the sample proportion is 0.92. This means that in my sample 92 reference strings were successfully matched to the right DOIs. Not too bad.</p>\n<p>I could now treat this number as the estimate and assume that 0.92 is close to the population proportion. On the other hand, this is only a sample, and a rather small one, which raises doubts. What if our 92 correct matches happen to be the only correct matches in the entire 1M population? In such a case, our estimate of 0.92 would be very far from the population proportion. This uncertainty related to sampling randomness can be captured by the confidence interval.</p>\n<h4 id=\"confidence-interval\">Confidence interval</h4>\n<p>The confidence interval for my 100-point sample, at the confidence level 95%, is 0.8668-0.9732. This is interpreted as follows: we are 95% sure that the real population proportion is within the range 0.8668-0.9732. Note that the sample average (0.92) is exactly in the middle of this range.</p>\n<p>100 items is not a big sample. Let&rsquo;s calculate the confidence interval for a sample 10 times larger. From a sample of size 1000 I got the estimate 0.932, and the confidence interval 0.9164-0.9476. Based on this, we can be 95% sure that the real population proportion is within the range 0.9164-0.9476.</p>\n<p>It seems the our interval got smaller when we increased the sample size. Let&rsquo;s plot the intervals for a variety of sample sizes:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/sampling_ci_by_size.png\" alt=\"confidence interval vs sample size\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>The blue line represents the estimated proportion for samples of different sizes, and the grey vertical lines are confidence intervals. The estimated proportion varies, because for each size a different sample was drawn.</p>\n<p>We can see that increasing the sample size decreases the interval. This should make intuitive sense: if we have more data to estimate from, we can expect our estimate to be more reliable (i.e. closer to the population proportion).</p>\n<p>What about the confidence level? By setting the confidence level we specify, how certain we want to be about our confidence interval. So far I used 95%. What happens if I calculate the confidence intervals for my original sample of 100 records, but with varying confidence level?</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/sampling_ci_by_cl.png\" alt=\"confidence interval vs confidence level\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>In this case the average is always the same, because only one sample was used.</p>\n<p>As we can see, increasing the confidence level widens the interval. In other words, the more certain we want to be about the interval containing the real population average, the wider the interval has to be.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sampling-distribution\">Sampling distribution</h4>\n<p>So far so good, but where does this magic confidence interval actually come from? It is calculated by the theoretical analysis of the sampling distribution (not to be confused with sample distribution):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sample distribution</strong> is when we collect one sample of size <em>k</em> and calculate a certain feature for every element in the sample. It is a distribution of <em>k</em> values of the feature in one sample.</li>\n<li><strong>Sampling distribution</strong> is when we independently collect <em>n</em> samples, each of size <em>k</em>, and calculate the sample proportion for each sample. It is the distribution of <em>n</em> sample proportions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imagine I collect all samples of size 100 from my population and I calculate the sample proportion for each sample. This is the sampling distribution. Now I randomly choose one number from this sampling distribution. Note that this is equivalent to what I did before: choosing one random sample of size 100 and calculating its sample proportion.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\" target=\"_blank\">Central Limit Theorem</a>, sampling distribution is approximately normal with the mean equal to the population proportion. Here is the visualisation of the sampling distribution:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/sampling_sampling_distribution.png\" alt=\"visualization of sampling distribution\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>The black vertical line shows the mean of the sampling distribution. This is also the real population proportion. The grey area covers the middle 95% of the distribution mass (within 2 standard deviations from the mean).</p>\n<p>When we choose one sample and calculate the sample proportion, there are two possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With 95% probability, we were lucky and the sample proportion is within the grey area. In that case, the real population proportion is not further than 2 standard deviations from our estimate.</li>\n<li>With 5% probability, we were unlucky and the sample proportion is outside the grey area. In that case, the real population proportion is further than 2 standard deviations from our estimate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So with the confidence of 95% we can say that the real population proportion is within 2 standard deviations from our sample proportion. We can see now that these 2 standard deviations of the sampling distribution define our confidence interval at the confidence level of 95%.</p>\n<p>Smaller confidence level would make the grey area narrower, and the confidence interval would shrink as well. Larger confidence level makes the grey area, and the confidence interval, larger.</p>\n<p>To look more closely at the sampling distribution, I generated sampling distributions for all combinations of &ldquo;<em>n</em> samples of size <em>k</em>&rdquo;, where <em>n</em> and <em>k</em> are the elements of the set {25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200}. This is only an approximation, since the real sampling distributions would contain many more samples.</p>\n<p>Here is the heatmap showing the mean of each sampling distribution (this should be approximately the same as the real population proportion):</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/sampling_sampling_means.png\" alt=\"means of sampling distributions\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>We can see that there is some variability in the top left part of the heatmap, which corresponds to small sample sizes and small numbers of samples. The bottom right part of the heatmap shows much less variability. As we increase the sample size and number of samples, the mean of the sampling distribution approaches numbers around 0.933.</p>\n<p>Here is the heatmap showing the standard deviation for each sampling distribution:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/sampling_sampling_stdevs.png\" alt=\"standard deviations of sampling distributions\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>We can clearly see how the standard deviation decreases when we increase the sample size. This is consistent with the previous observation, that the confidence interval decreases when the sample size is increased.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s also see the histograms of all the sampling distributions:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/sampling_sampling_histograms.png\" alt=\"histograms of sampling distributions\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>Here we can see the following patterns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All histograms indeed seem to be centered around approximately the same number.</li>\n<li>The more samples we include, the more normal the sampling distribution appears. This happens because with more samples the real sampling distribution is better approximated.</li>\n<li>The larger the sample size, the narrower the sampling distribution (i.e. smaller standard deviation).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-estimation-vs-the-real-value\">The estimation vs. the real value</h4>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to my original question. What is the proportion of reference strings in APA style, that are successfully matched to the original DOIs of the records they were generated from? So far we observed the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A small sample of 100 gave the estimate 0.92 (confidence interval 0.8668-0.9732)</li>\n<li>A larger samples of 1000 gave the estimate 0.932 (confidence interval 0.9164-0.9476)</li>\n<li>The means of sampling distributions seem to slowly approach 0.933</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what is the real population proportion in my case? It is 0.933005. As we can see, the estimations were fairly close, and the intervals indeed contain the real value.</p>\n<p>Now I can also calculate the confidence interval for each sample in my sampling distributions, and then the fraction of the intervals that contain the real population proportion (I expect these numbers to be close to the confidence level 95%). Here is the heatmap:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/sampling_sampling_fractions.png\" alt=\"fractions of samples containing the real proportion in confidence interval\" width=\"500px\" />\n<p>We can see that for larger sample sizes indeed the fractions are high. The fraction is not always above 95%, as we would expect, especially for smaller sample sizes. One of the reasons is that when we calculate the confidence interval, we approximate the standard deviation of the population with the standard deviation of the sample. This is not always a reliable estimate, especially for small samples. This suggests that sample sizes of at least 1000-2000 should be used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"be-careful\">Be careful</h3>\n<p>Some important things to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aggregate functions</strong>. As mentioned before, apart from estimating the proportion, a similar procedure can be applied for estimating the average of a certain numeric feature.</li>\n<li><strong>(Lack of) certainty</strong>. Remember that the confidence level &lt; 1. This means that we are never sure that our confidence interval contains the true population proportion. If for any reason you need to be 100% sure, just process the entire dataset.</li>\n<li><strong>Randomness</strong>, a.k.a. “stirring before tasting”. The sample has to be chosen randomly. Beware of assuming that the dataset is shuffled and taking the first 1000 rows!</li>\n<li><strong>Sample size</strong>. We know already that the larger the sample, the better. As a rule of thumb, using sample sizes &lt; 30 makes the estimates, including the interval, rather unreliable.</li>\n<li><strong>Skewness</strong>. In general, the more skewed the original feature distribution, the larger sample we need. In case of the proportion, the sample should contain at least 5 data points of each value of the feature (passes/doesn&rsquo;t pass the test).</li>\n<li><strong>Generalization</strong>. The sample average/proportion can be used as an estimate for the population average/proportion, but only the population it was drawn from. This means that if we applied any filters before sampling (which is equivalent to sampling from a subset passing the filter), we can reason only about the filtered subset of the data.</li>\n<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>. This is more of an engineering concern. In short, all the analyses we do should be reproducible. In the context of sampling it means, at the very least, that we should record the samples we use.</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":null,"title":"Why Data Citation matters to publishers and data repositories","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/why-data-citation-matters-to-publishers-and-data-repositories/","published":"Thu, 08 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"A couple of weeks ago we shared with you that data citation is here, and that you can start doing data citation today.

But why would you want to? There are always so many priorities, why should this be at the top of the list?</p>\n<p>I’m sure you heard this before—data sharing and data citation are important for scientific progress. The three key reasons for this are:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-transparency-and-reproducibility\">1) Transparency and reproducibility</h3>\n<p>Most scientific results that are shared today are just a summary of what researchers did and found. The underlying data are not available, making it difficult to verify and replicate results. If data would always be made available with publications, transparency of research would be greatly improved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-reuse\">2) Reuse</h3>\n<p>The availability of raw data allows other researchers to reuse the data. Not just for replication purposes, but to answer new research questions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-credit\">3) Credit</h3>\n<p>When researchers cite the data they used, this forms the basis for a data credit system. Right now researchers are not really incentivized to share their data, because nobody is looking at data metrics and measuring their impact. Data citation is a first step towards changing that.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/dc.png\" alt=\"data article nexus\" width=\"500px\" />\n</div>\n<p>The benefits described above are all quite long-term, so why, as a publisher or data repository, should you put your resources towards implementing data citation workflows now? During our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5438/qm7p-wy23\" target=\"_blank\">pre-conference workshop at FORCE2018</a> we asked repositories and publishers this question. Below you’ll find some of the answers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-repositories\">Data repositories</h3>\n<p>For data repositories, data citation leads to increased visibility of both the repository and the datasets. The workshop revealed that many repositories do a lot of work to establish links between articles and datasets, thereby significantly contributing to transparency in research. Some of the repositories explained that they hire curators that text mine articles to find associations and manually curate datasets to ensure information about links is part of the metadata. This is reflected in Event Data, where 99% of links between articles and datasets comes from data repository metadata. This downstream enrichment of metadata is useful, but it would be more effective if all stakeholders strive to establish these links at a much earlier stage in the research communication process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/\" target=\"_blank\">ICPSR</a>, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, shared:</p>\n<p>ICPSR views data citation as vital. As a large social science data archive, ICPSR curates, preserves, and distributes data for the research community to re-use over time. Data citation makes data visible to the research community. Without it, data cannot be accessed for re-use or reproduced for transparency. Its use cannot be tracked and counted to reveal its impact and potential for new uses by investigators in new fields or in combination with new types of data. Data creators cannot receive adequate credit for their intellectual output. And the original investment by funders and scientists to create those data stops producing dividends. Therefore, data citation plays an essential role in the data sharing lifecycle.</p>\n<p>Proper data citation, with a unique identifier, makes it much easier to measure impact. When data use is not cited or cited obliquely, it is rendered virtually invisible. Hence, much data use is still not easily detected. The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181206103836/https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/citations/\" target=\"_blank\">ICPSR Bibliography of Data-related Literature</a> represents ICPSR’s efforts to identify publications that analyze data distributed at ICPSR and link them directly to the data in the ICPSR catalog. As of 2018, ICPSR has a searchable database that contains nearly 80,000 citations of published and unpublished works resulting from analyses of data held in the archive. ICPSR also makes the case for data citation in its brief new video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiCZKV-alC0\" target=\"_blank\">“ICPSR 101: Why Should I Cite Data?”</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gbif.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GBIF</a>, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, explained:</p>\n<p>The work required to collect, clean, compile and publish biodiversity datasets is significant and deserves recognition. Researchers publish studies based on data made available through <a href=\"https://www.gbif.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GBIF.org</a> at a rate of about 2 papers every single day. It is crucial for GBIF to link these scientific uses to the underlying data as one measure of demonstrating the value and impact of sharing free and open biodiversity data. At the moment, however, only about 10 percent of authors cite or acknowledge the datasets used in research papers properly. As a result, data publishers efforts often risk going unnoticed, and the true impact of sharing data remains invisible. GBIF will continue to work with publishers and researchers to provide guidance and input for how to best cite the use of GBIF-mediated data in scientific journals to ensure proper attribution and reproducible research and to demonstrate the true value of free and open access to biodiversity data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"publishers\">Publishers</h3>\n<p>By ensuring data is cited in a consistent way, publishers help provide transparency and context for the content they publish. Depositing that information as part of the Crossref metadata helps that work go further by uncovering how data is being used across multiple publications and publishers This means patterns can be explored and researchers can gain more comprehensive recognition and credit for the work they have done.</p>\n<p>Melissa Harrison, Head of Production Operations at <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/\" target=\"_blank\">eLife</a> says:</p>\n<p>eLife is committed to ensuring researchers get credit for all their outputs, and data is a major component of this. We&rsquo;re working with Crossref and JATS4R to enable publishers to tag their JATS data content consistently and thus create an easy crosswalk to their Crossref deposits. The JATS4R guidance on Data Availability Statements, linked to and incorporating data citations, will be updated soon, please watch that space!</p>\n<p>It will be really interesting to see how much re-use of previously published data is happening, look for patterns in re-use, and see links and hopefully building up of data by different research groups. Ultimately, this will incentivize researchers and publishers to ensure it is correctly accredited at source and in publications, improving the cycle further.’</p>\n<p>Anita de Waard, VP of Research Collaborations at <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Elsevier</a>, says:</p>\n<p>One of the key recommendations of the <a href=\"https://www.force11.org/about/manifesto\" target=\"_blank\">Force11 Manifesto</a> was to “<a href=\"https://www.force11.org/about/manifesto#x1-200003.3\" target=\"_blank\">3.3</a> Add data, software, and workflows into the publication as first-class research objects”, which will allow greater reproducibility and rigor to experimental research, and allow the reuse of all digital artefacts in the scholarly lifecycle. By following the data citation principles, we achieve two things: the author presents a richer representation of their work, and the data producer receives credit for the hard work of curating and publishing citable datasets.</p>\n<p>Mendeley Data and Elsevier are active contributors to the <a href=\"http://www.scholix.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Scholix framework</a> that as a collaborative and open standard, allows the open mining of relationships between articles and datasets. We are also active participants in the new <a href=\"http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Enabling FAIR Data Project</a>, and next to <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elsevier-supports-top-guidelines-in-ongoing-efforts-to-ensure-research-quality-and-transparency\" target=\"_blank\">supporting the TOP Guidelines</a> in all domains, require all authors in the earth and space sciences to deposit their data before publication.</p>\n<p>Next week at <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual/\">Crossref LIVE18</a>, Patricia Cruse from DataCite will talk about Data Citations and why they matter. If you’re in Toronto next week, do not hesitate to ask her or anyone from Crossref anything you want to know about data citation!</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Ten more days 'til Toronto","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/ten-more-days-til-toronto/","published":"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Our LIVE Annual Meeting is back in North America for the first time since 2015, and with just 10 days to go, there’s a lot going on in preparation.

There was also a lot of discussion around OJS integrations, and we were able to share that PKP/OJS is currently in the process of enhancing the Crossref/OJS integration, including the ability for publishers to deposit references.</p>\n<p>We were also pleased to see so much interest in supplementing Crossref metadata with references, Similarity Check URLs, license information, etc. To address this we’re running a webinar in Brazilian Portuguese entitled: “Registering content and adding to your Crossref metadata in Portuguese” on 26th November.

As a not-for-profit membership organization that is obsessed with persistence, we have a duty to remain sustainable and manage our finances in a responsible way. Our annual audit is incredibly thorough, and our outside auditors and Board-based Audit committee consistently report that we’re in good shape.</p>\n<p>Our Membership &amp; Fees committee regularly reviews both membership fees and Content Registration fees for a growing range of research outputs. Together with our staff, the Board regularly reviews financial projections that inform our budgeting process and approve our budget each year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"financial-sustainability-means-the-persistence-of-our-infrastructure-and-services\">Financial sustainability means the persistence of our infrastructure and services</h3>\n<p>We run a tight ship here at Crossref. We have to. So it’s not ideal when we have to chase members and users for late payments, but it’s an important part of keeping the organization afloat, and keeping our dedicated service to scholarly communications running. And that’s my job at Crossref.</p>\n<p>Working here for over six years now, I’ve seen a lot of development in our finance department. We strive as a team to always improve our communication with members and users to deliver the best ‘customer’ experience. To do this, we are always tweaking our processes to improve efficiency and accuracy, and <a href=\"mailto:billing@crossref.org\">welcome all feedback</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-the-invoice-schedule-works\">How the invoice schedule works</h3>\n<p>Our annual membership invoices are sent out each January, and our Content Registration invoices are generated four times a year, each quarter. All invoices are emailed to the billing contact for your organization (please be sure to update us with any contact changes!) and have a due date of net 45 days. Our invoices now have a “pay now” link in the body of the email. This offers a faster and more convenient way for you to pay, simply by clicking on the link to our payment portal. You can also view invoices as PDFs in the payment portal. An important part of our accounting process is the automated invoice reminder schedule. There are three billing reminders we send by email:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The day immediately after the invoice due date;</li>\n<li>21 days past the invoice due date; and</li>\n<li>45 days past the invoice due date.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"we-dont-want-to-see-you-go\">We don’t want to see you go!</h3>\n<p>We understand there are many factors that can make prompt payment a challenge for some people: international transfer delays or fees; funding for your publishing operations may end; change of contacts; problems receiving our emails.</p>\n<p>When an account is 90 days past due, a further email notifies you that your service is at risk of suspension. If an account is then suspended for non-payment it becomes at risk of being ‘terminated’. Once an account has been terminated, you will need to contact our membership specialist to rejoin Crossref. Please note that we send numerous notifications/reminders before suspension or termination takes place (we don’t want to see you go!). We can always be reached at <a href=\"mailto:billing@crossref.or\">billing@crossref.org</a> for any invoice inquiries you may have.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tips-that-work-for-other-users\">Tips that work for other users</h3>\n<p>There are some things you can do to speed-up or simplify payments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay with a credit card, using our online payment portal. This is fast, convenient, and lower in fees</li>\n<li>Always reference an invoice number on the payment to ensure that it’s applied to your account efficiently</li>\n<li>Be sure to make <a href=\"mailto:billing@crossref.org\"><code>billing@crossref.org</code></a> a ‘safe’ email address, so that you receive our invoices and reminders</li>\n<li>Always keep us up-to-date with any contact changes at your organization, to ensure that we have accurate information for invoicing and other communication</li>\n<li>We recommend giving us a generic email address for your accounts payable team, such as <code>accounts@publisher.com</code> so that if somebody leaves that job, invoices can still get through.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for working with us!

Over the past ten years, the members of the books group have updated and added to the guide, and it’s now time for it to get some visibility, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/content-types-intro/books-and-chapters/\">so we have added it to our website</a> for easy reference.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/bookcontent.png\" alt=\"bookscontent\" width=\"75%\" />\n</p>\n<p>These best practices are not documented for the sake of it. They have real value and can help guide internal conversations to evaluate current practices, for example. They can also play a role in making or changing policies, training staff and providing instructions to authors on citation formatting.</p>\n<p>Here are a few recent changes I’d like to highlight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new section has been added that addresses books hosted on multiple platforms</li>\n<li>The section on versions, (including books in multiple formats) has been expanded and clarified</li>\n<li>A section on the use of DOIs in citations has been added</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is neither final nor comprehensive, and never will be. Best practices by their very nature must evolve over time—and those with such a broad scope as books will inevitably lack some detail—but that’s all the more reason for the community to stay engaged. Looking ahead to future work from the group, chapter-level metadata is likely to get more attention.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years the Books Advisory Group, chaired with aplomb by Emily Ayubi of the American Psychological Association (APA), has spent a lot of time on Crossref initiatives, like <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/get-started/multiple-resolution/\">Multiple Resolution</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/5jchdy\" target=\"_blank\">DOI display changes</a> but also on broader industry topics like ORCID iDs for book authors, and the Books Citation Index.</p>\n<p>As Emily’s term as chair comes to an end this year, we welcome Charles Watkinson of the University of Michigan as chair starting in 2019. The group meets next on 12 December when we will hear from <a href=\"https://coko.foundation/\" target=\"_blank\">Coko</a> about Editoria and have a discussion about developing our new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-manager-members-represent/\">Metadata Manager</a> Content Registration tool for books, and more.</p>\n<p>If you want to share your thoughts on best practices or if you have other topics you’d like us to consider, <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">please get in touch</a>.</p>\n<hr>"},{"id":null,"title":"Metadata Manager: Members, represent!","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-manager-members-represent/","published":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Over 100 Million unique scholarly works are distributed into systems across the research enterprise 24/7 via our APIs at a rate of around 633 Million queries a month.

It contains 34.6 million abstracts and 5 million full-text articles. At Europe PMC we support the research community by developing tools for knowledge discovery, linking publications with underlying research data, and building infrastructure to support text and data mining. Our goal is to create a supportive environment around open access content and data, to maximise its reuse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-problem-is-your-service-trying-to-solve\">What problem is your service trying to solve?</h3>\n<p>Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/preprints\">the popularity of preprints</a> within life sciences literature. Preprints have been supported by Crossref since November 2016. In response to the rise in popularity, we have started indexing preprints alongside traditional journal publishing within Europe PMC. We expect this will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>provide another means to access and discover this emergent form of scholarly content</li>\n<li>help explore more transparently the role of preprints in the publishing ecosystem</li>\n<li>support their inclusion in processes such as grant reporting and credit attribution systems</li>\n</ol>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/epmc1.png\" alt=\"context\" width=\"75%\" />\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-you-use-crossref-metadata\">How do you use Crossref metadata?</h3>\n<p>Europe PMC operates an open citation network that uses reference lists from our full-text content, supplemented with metadata supplied by the Crossref OAI-PMH API. The number of citations we retrieve from Crossref increased significantly in 2017 thanks to the efforts of the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Initiative for Open Citations</a> (I4OC) in improving awareness about sharing citation data.</p>\n<p>Our work to ingest preprints into Europe PMC, however, represents our first use of the Crossref REST API. We make a series of queries for each preprint provider, making use of the “posted-content”, “prefix” and (optionally) “has-abstract” filters. We intend to migrate to using the REST API for the majority of retrievals of Crossref content in due course.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-metadata-values-do-you-make-use-of\">What metadata values do you make use of?</h3>\n<p>Currently we make use of the following fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>posted</code> as a publication date</li>\n<li><code>abstract</code></li>\n<li><code>DOI</code></li>\n<li><code>author</code> for author given names and surnames</li>\n<li><code>title</code> as the preprint title</li>\n<li><code>is-preprint-of</code> to establish preprint –&gt; article links</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-often-do-you-extractquery-metadata\">How often do you extract/query metadata?</h3>\n<p>We query the REST API daily making use of the <code>from-index-date</code> filter and cursor pagination to insert new or modify existing records. This means that preprints will be available in Europe PMC within 24 hours of the metadata being sent to Crossref. We store the full REST response in MongoDB, a document-based database. Here are some examples of Crossref API queries used to preprint provider <em>PeerJ Preprints</em>:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>calling `https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=type:posted-content,has-abstract:true,from-index-date:2018-07-29,prefix:10.7287&amp;sort=updated&amp;rows=1000&amp;cursor=*`\ncalling `https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=type:posted-content,has-abstract:true,from-index-date:2018-07-29,prefix:10.7287&amp;sort=updated&amp;rows=1000&amp;cursor=AoN4ldf88uQCe6e1g%2FPkAj8SaHR0cDovL2R4LmRvaS5vcmcvMTAuNzI4Ny9wZWVyai5wcmVwcmludHMuMjcwNjJ2MQ%3D%3D`\nDone importing PeerJ Preprints\nmodified: 2\ninserted: 10\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"what-do-you-do-with-the-metadata\">What do you do with the metadata?</h3>\n<p>From the database we parse out the relevant fields and pass them to our main relational database prior to indexing. This avails the preprint abstracts to all of the value-added services we offer for peer-reviewed abstracts, such as citations, grants, ORCID claiming, text mining, etc. We assign a unique persistent identifier comprising “PPR” followed by a number (1) to each preprint record.</p>\n<p>This is displayed on the Europe PMC site as an abstract record, analogous to PubMed records, but with an obvious banner (2) indicating to readers the preprint designation; a tooltip provides further explanation of what a preprint is in comparison to a peer-reviewed article.</p>\n<p>Once available on the Europe PMC platform, we then apply downstream processes including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>providing an Unpaywall link directly to the full-text (3);</li>\n<li>adding a hyperlink to the final published version (if there is one that we can detect) (4);</li>\n<li>incorporating the preprint into our citation network (5);</li>\n<li>adding useful links to e.g. alternative metrics, scientific comments and peer reviews, underlying research data in life science databases (6);</li>\n<li>providing text mined annotations via SciLite (7);</li>\n<li>including funding information (8);</li>\n<li>displaying ORCID claims in the author list (9).</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/epmc2.png\" alt=\"context\" width=\"75%\" />\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-future-plans-for-europe-pmc-and-preprints\">What are the future plans for Europe PMC and preprints?</h3>\n<p>The inclusion of preprints within Europe PMC is of immediate benefit to researchers who want to explore the very latest research. Moreover we see this as an opportunity for both ourselves and the community to explore how preprints fit into the wider publishing ecosystem; for example to answer questions such as: How often will they be cited? How will they be linked to grant funding and other credit systems? How will they be reused?</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-else-would-you-like-our-api-to-do\">What else would you like our API to do?</h3>\n<p>The REST API and rich metadata model provided by Crossref around preprints are both excellent, but the population of the metadata fields by preprint providers can be limited and/or heterogeneous. The key challenge we see is in encouraging providers to populate the Crossref metadata fields more fully and in a uniform manner.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks to Michael.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to share how you use our Metadata APIs please contact the <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">Community team</a>.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"A wrap up of the Crossref blog series for SciELO","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-wrap-up-of-the-crossref-blog-series-for-scielo/","published":"Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Crossref member SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), based in Brazil, celebrated two decades of operation last week with a three-day event The SciELO 20 Years Conference.

At Crossref and DataCite we are seeing growth in journal articles and other content types citing data, and datasets making the link the other way. Our organizations are committed to working together to help realize the data citation community’s ambition, so we’re embarking on a dedicated effort to get things moving.</p>\n<p>Efforts regarding data citation are not a new thing. One of the first large-scale initiatives to establish data citation as a standard academic practice was the FORCE11 <a href=\"https://www.force11.org/datacitationprinciples\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles</a> (JDDCP) in 2014. This declaration was endorsed by over 100 organizations in the scholarly community as well as many individuals.</p>\n<p>Following this agreement on how data citation should be done, many projects followed. Within FORCE11, the <a href=\"https://www.force11.org/group/dcip\" target=\"_blank\">Data Citation Implementation Pilot</a> brought together publishers and repositories to put data citation into practice and work on the implementation of the JDDCP. Within the context of the <a href=\"https://www.rd-alliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Research Data Alliance</a>, a data-literature linking group started under the name of <a href=\"http://www.scholix.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Scholix</a> to establish a framework for exchanging information about the relationships between articles and datasets. The infrastructure building blocks now feed into projects such as <a href=\"https://makedatacount.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Make Data Count</a> and <a href=\"http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Enabling FAIR Data</a>.</p>\n<p>Projects aside, if datasets are cited consistently and in a standard way, it will make it much easier for the research community to see links between different research outputs and work with these outputs. It also makes it much easier to count these citations, so that researchers can get credit for their data and the sharing of that data.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/data_article_nexus_short.png\" alt=\"An exemplary image\" width=\"500px\" />\n</div>\n<p>The underlying work has been done to create an infrastructure that will effectively support and disseminate information on data citation. Data citation is here today!</p>\n<p>Different organizations know how to handle data citations, and are starting to count these and make that information available in turn. This means that the only thing that’s needed is for people to actually cite data, and this information be captured and passed on. Some Crossref and DataCite members have already made great progress on this already (see Melissa Harrison’s <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/data-citations-and-the-elife-story-so-far/\">blog on what eLife is doing</a>).</p>\n<p>The goals of all the data citation projects can only be realized if you start doing data citation, and we know you’ll have questions about it…</p>\n<p>In the coming months, we’ll be posting several blogs and organizing sessions to tell you how you can start doing data citation - if you’re attending FORCE2018 you can catch our <a href=\"https://force2018.sched.com/event/Fs0A/contributing-and-consuming-data-metrics-to-make-your-data-count\" target=\"_blank\">joint workshop</a> there.

It’s a valuable education tool for publishers, institutions and other service providers looking to understand the availability of the metadata they have registered with us.</p>\n<p>Through an itemized dashboard Participation Reports allows you to monitor the metadata you are registering, even if this work is done by a third party or another department. You can see for yourself where your gaps are, and what you could improve upon. Next to each metadata element, there’s a short definition, letting you know more about it, and—crucially—what practical steps you can take to improve the score.</p>\n<p>The dashboard provides the percentage counts across ten key metadata elements: References, ORCID iDs, Funder Registry IDs, Funding award numbers, Crossmark metadata, License URLs, Text-mining links, Similarity Check URLs, and Abstracts.</p>\n<p>And not only can you see your own metadata—the dashboard enables you to view the registered metadata of all our 11,076 members.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-these-100-million-content-records-being-used\">How are these 100 Million content records being used?</h3>\n<p>Every service we provide is based on our metadata, and our APIs expose all of that metadata.

So it makes sense for the metadata you deposit to be as accurate and complete as possible. The more elements there are to the metadata, the higher the chance of others finding and using the content. We aim to continually find effective ways to communicate this wider story around the importance of open infrastructure and metadata.</p>\n<p>Over the years we’ve made great progress in connecting information about researchers, their affiliations, grants, and research outputs.

He joined five years ago as an editor and has worked on editorial, production, and software projects. Prior to joining MDPI, he completed a PhD and worked as a postdoc. His research covered physical chemistry, biochemistry and instrument development.\nBastien Latard is the project leader of Scilit. He created Scilit as part of his Master’s degree in 2013. He is now completing a PhD on the subject of semantically linking research articles, using data from Scilit.</p>\n<p>Scilit was developed in 2014 by open access (OA) publisher MDPI with the goal of having a backup of metadata for all OA articles. Soon, Scilit became more general and embraced all articles with a digital object identifier (DOI) from Crossref and those with a Pubmed ID (PMID). After seeing the potential of the database and how it could be used in a number of different contexts, we decided to make it public. Recently, other article types, including preprints have been integrated. Our main goal now is to provide useful services to the research and academic publishing communities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-problem-is-your-service-trying-to-solve\">What problem is your service trying to solve?</h2>\n<p>Other indexing databases offer paid access, are highly selective, or host documents apart from research articles. We want to offer a comprehensive database, but also one that clearly identifies open access material. The last part is still a work in progress, but we have made good progress recently.</p>\n<p>To make the access as direct as possible, we have recently integrated several OA aggregators that pick up or host free versions of full-text articles, including CORE, Unpaywall, and PubMed Central.</p>\n<h2 id=\"can-you-tell-us-how-you-are-using-the-crossref-metadata-api-at-mdpiscilit\">Can you tell us how you are using the Crossref Metadata API at MDPI/Scilit?</h2>\n<p>Scilit queries Crossref’s API in order to index metadata for single articles. DOIs are a key part of the system; because they are standards, we can use them to merge new sources into Scilit while avoiding duplicates. We cross-check the data from Crossref against other sources and update it as necessary. Citation data is also really appreciated and opens doors to further developments.</p>\n<p>As a publisher, MDPI makes daily deposits to Crossref, to register journal articles on <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mdpi.com</a>, conference papers from <a href=\"https://sciforum.net\" target=\"_blank\">sciforum.net</a>, and preprints from <a href=\"https://www.preprints.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Preprints.org</a>. We also use the data collected at Scilit to find suitable reviewers and let authors know when their work has been cited.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-metadata-values-do-you-pull-from-the-api\">What metadata values do you pull from the API?</h2>\n<p>As much as we can! Scilit crawls the latest indexed articles every few hours to ensure it is as up-to-date as possible. This is the most important function of our system because it provides metadata for the very latest published articles, including a link to the publisher version. Scilit parses Crossref metadata and saves them. They are then indexed into our solr search engine for fast, real-time usage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-you-built-your-own-interface-to-extract-this-data\">Have you built your own interface to extract this data?</h2>\n<p>We wrote our own code to get the data, but the API interface made this very straightforward. Scilit has been developed completely in-house by MDPI and the lead developer, Bastien Latard, is currently completing a PhD looking at how to make the most of the data using semantic data extraction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-future-plans-for-mdpiscilit\">What are the future plans for MDPI/Scilit?</h2>\n<p>Scilit is and will be highly used in MDPI current and future projects. We have a few ideas about how to improve Scilit. We are, for example, implementing a scientific profile networking service, which will allow scholars to build their own (scientific) network with lots of functionalities. We think that it will be a really good place to search, comment, exchange around articles… maybe even more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-would-you-like-to-see-the-rest-api-offer\">What else would you like to see the REST API offer?</h2>\n<p>Crossref is already doing a great job, especially with its integrated citation data. Maybe further analysis and mapping of data about organizations and institutions would be an improvement.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thank you Martin and Bastien.

Is open infrastructure for scholarly communication the key to achieving persistence?<br></li>\n<li>PIDs for emerging uses: Long-term identifiers are no longer just for digital objects. We have use cases for people, organizations, vocabulary terms, and more. What additional use cases are you working on?<br></li>\n<li>Legacy PIDs: There are of thousands of venerable old identifier systems that people want to continue using and bring into the modern data citation ecosystem. How can we manage this effectively?<br></li>\n<li>Bridging worlds: What would make heterogeneous PID systems &lsquo;interoperate&rsquo; optimally? Would standardized metadata and APIs across PID types solve many of the problems, and if so, how would that be achieved? What about standardized link/relation types?<br></li>\n<li>PIDagogy: It’s a challenge for those who provide PID services and tools to engage the wider community. How do you teach, learn, persuade, discuss, and improve adoption? What&rsquo;s it mean to build a pedagogy for PIDs?<br></li>\n<li>PID stories: Which strategies worked? Which strategies failed? Tell us your horror stories! Share your victories!<br></li>\n<li>Kinds of persistence: What are the frontiers of &lsquo;persistence&rsquo;?

As the record is processed, we make the link available going both directions, while preserving the provenance of the statement in the metadata output (&ldquo;asserted-by&rdquo;: &ldquo;subject&rdquo; or &ldquo;asserted-by&rdquo;: &ldquo;object&rdquo;). This results in bidirectional assertions in the Crossref REST API where search engines, analytics providers, indexes, etc. can get from the preprint to the article (“is-preprint-of”) as well as vice versa (“has-preprint”), making it easier to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse.</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/\" target=\"_blank\">rOpenSci’s</a> R library for the Crossref REST API (rcrossref), we pulled all articles connected to a previous preprint (<a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=relation.type:has-preprint&amp;facet=publisher-name\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=relation.type:has-preprint&facet=publisher-name</a>:<em>&amp;rows=0) and then aggregated them based on journal via their ISSNs (<a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=relation.type:has-preprint&amp;facet=issn\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=relation.type:has-preprint&facet=issn</a>:</em>), tallying the results in a tidy table with the journal name (ex: PLOS Biology (<a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/journals/2167-8359%29%29\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/journals/2167-8359))</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-big-reveal\">The big reveal</h3>\n<p>So without further delay, let’s look at the results of the 20 journals with the highest number of preprints associated with its articles (data from August 21, 2018):</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Publisher</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Journal</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Count</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PeerJ</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PeerJ</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">1184</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Springer Nature</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Scientific Reports</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">394</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">eLife</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">eLife</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">375</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PLOS</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PLOS ONE</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">338</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PNAS</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">205</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PLOS</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PLOS Computational Biology</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">196</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Springer Nature</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Nature Communications</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">187</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PLOS</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PLOS Genetics</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">169</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">The Genetics Society of America</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Genetics</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">168</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Oxford University Press</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Nucleic Acids Research</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">148</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Oxford University Press</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Bioinformatics</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">138</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">The Genetics Society of America</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Genetics</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">120</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">The Genetics Society of America</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">104</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Genome Research</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">104</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Oxford University Press</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Molecular Biology and Evolution</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">MDPI AG</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Energies</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">98</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">MDPI AG</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Sensors</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">96</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Springer Nature</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">BMC Genomics</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">92</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">MDPI AG</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">International Journal of Molecular Sciences</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">86</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">JMIR Publications</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Journal of Medical Internet Research</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">83</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><br></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">This list has not been normalized or weighted based on the size of the journal. The following observations are informed speculations, as we can only infer so much from the raw data:</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Disciplinary practice:</b> This phenomenon where preprints are a part of disciplinary practice accounts for about half of the journals represented on the list. Certain communities such as genetics and computational fields have been early adopters of preprints. As such, we see higher rates of preprint-to-article publication in journals that publish their work.</li>\n<li><b>Partnerships:</b> Partnerships that facilitate submission from the preprint repository directly to a publisher or peer review service (ex: BioRxiv B2J program) make it easier for researchers to move from preprint-sharing seamlessly to submitting their journal article manuscript.</li>\n<li><b>Tie-ins:</b> A quarter of the journals on the list are run by publishers with a preprint service, and have been able to tie together both arms of publishing. This removes barriers to journal article submission in the same manner as integrations between repositories and publishers, but does so as a single party.</li>\n<li><b>Publisher support and treatment:</b> We also see that strong proponents and early partners of preprint repositories tend to have higher counts. Some publishers have been more outspoken in their welcome of preprints, such as <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180829235413/http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12630\" target=\"_blank\">PNAS</a>. Sometimes this support also comes in the form of special treatment. In the process of crafting editorial policy on publishing results previously posted in a preprint, some journals have carved out particular affordances in their publication workflow and content delivery streams that may contribute to the higher counts of articles. For example, Nature Research displays the preprints of submitted articles under consideration: <a href=\"https://nature-research-under-consideration.nature.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://nature-research-under-consideration.nature.com/</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Mega-journals:</b> Mega-journals such as Scientific Reports and PLOS ONE have not discouraged preprints. As such, and due to the size of their publication output, they have easily found a place among the higher counts on the list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"taking-a-closer-look\">Taking a closer look</h3>\n<p>One major consideration in these results, concerns what’s missing in the data. These fall into two camps: incomplete member data, and incomplete membership coverage.</p>\n<p>We have been working with our members to deposit preprints using the proper content type, and to provide links to published articles in their metadata. However, not all have yet done so (ex: SSRN), leading to holes in our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-research-nexus-better-research-through-better-metadata/\">research nexus graph</a>, which subsequently detracts from the completeness of the data.</p>\n<p>We celebrate the preprint repositories who are required to update their metadata when an article is published from a preprint, thereby populating the map with critical bridges between preprints and articles. Crossref participation benefits not only the content owner, but the membership at large and all the systems across the research ecosystem powered by Crossref metadata.</p>\n<p>Lastly, this data is dependent on the coverage of preprint repositories who register content with us. We are thrilled that <a href=\"https://cos.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Open Science</a>, our <a href=\"https://cos.io/blog/we-are-now-registering-preprint-dois-crossref/\" target=\"_blank\">newest preprints addition</a> who represents 21 community repositories, has recently filled in swaths of the map. But there remain dead zones in the research graph from repositories who are not Crossref members (ex: ArXiv). Their disciplines, as a result, are under represented in these results.</p>\n<h3 id=\"everyone-dive-in\">Everyone dive in!</h3>\n<p>As to the question of “where do preprints get published?”, anyone in fact can answer this question based on the metadata Crossref collects and provides to the community as an open infrastructure provider. We encourage the community to explore and analyze the data further with other available datasets to glean more insights on how scholarly communications is changing with the increasing growth of preprints. For example, the effective results across all journals represented can be weighted based on the number of articles published by each journal.</p>\n<p>Crossref data is open for all to examine and reuse through our <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a>.

Kudos is a platform that allows researchers and research groups to plan, manage, measure, and report on dissemination activities to help maximize the visibility and impact of their work.</p>\n<p>We launched the service in 2015 and now work with almost 100 publishers and institutions around the world, and have nearly 250,000 researchers using the platform.</p>\n<p>We provide guidance to researchers on writing a plain language summary about their work so it can be found and understood by a broad range of audiences, and then we support researchers in disseminating across multiple channels and measuring which dissemination activities are most effective for them.</p>\n<p>As part of this, we developed the <a href=\"https://blog.growkudos.com/2017/11/15/kudos-solution-illegal-sharing-copyright-content/\" target=\"_blank\">Sharable-PDF</a> to allow researchers to legitimately share publication profiles across a range of sites and networks, and track the impact of their work centrally.

When we receive notification from our publishing partners that an article, book or book chapter has been published, we query using the Crossref REST API to retrieve the metadata for that publication. That data allows us to populate the Kudos publication page.</p>\n<p>We also integrate earlier in the researcher workflow, interfacing with all of the major <a href=\"https://blog.growkudos.com/2018/03/28/extended-integrations-with-manuscript-submission-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">Manuscript Submission Systems</a> to support authors who want to build impact from the point of submission.</p>\n<p>More recently, we started using the Crossref REST API to retrieve citation counts for a DOI. This enables us to include the number of times content is cited as part of the ‘basket of metrics’ we provide to our researchers. They can then understand the performance of their publications in context, and see the correlation between actions and results.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/kudos-metrics.png\" alt=\"Kudos metrics page\" width=\"75%\" />\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">A Kudos metrics page, showing the basket of metrics and the correlation between actions and results</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-future-plans-for-kudos\">What are the future plans for Kudos?</h3>\n<p>We have exciting plans for the future! We are developing Kudos for Research Groups to support the planning, managing, measuring and reporting of dissemination activities for research groups, labs and departments. We are adding a range of new features and dissemination channels to support this, and to help researchers to better understand how their research is being used, and by whom.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-else-would-kudos-like-to-see-in-crossref-metadata\">What else would Kudos like to see in Crossref metadata?</h3>\n<p>We have always found Crossref to be very responsive and open to new ideas, so we look forward to continuing to work together. We are keen to see an industry standard article-level subject classification system developed, and it would seem that Crossref is the natural home for this.</p>\n<p>We are also continuing to monitor <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/\">Crossref Event Data</a> which has the potential to provide a rich source of events that could be used to help demonstrate dissemination and impact.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are pleased to see the work Crossref are doing to help improve the quality of the metadata and supporting publishers in auditing their data. If we could have anything we wanted, our dream would be to prevent “funny characters” in DOIs that cause us all kinds of escape character headaches!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thank you David.

We are pleased to formally integrate them into the scholarly record, giving the scholars who participated credit for their work, ensuring readers and systems dependably get from the reviews to the article (and vice versa), and making sure that links to these works persist over time.</p>\n<p>Many of our members make the peer review history available to researchers in different ways. Their extra effort to post review materials alongside the article will now go further once they are registered with us and linked to the journal article. They spoke of publishing peer reviews as a standard part of their publishing operation. The scholarly contributions of their editors and referees are validated, stewarded, and published in the manner of the articles: as per general practice. To fully realize this, they are ensuring that these publications are discoverable, citable, and part of the formal scholarly record—for all the thousands of systems which draw on Crossref metadata.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Article metadata + peer review metadata = a fuller picture of the evolution of knowledge</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-growing-collection\">The growing collection</h2>\n<p>As of August 12, 2018 three publishers have registered <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/types/peer-review/works?facet=publisher-name:*&amp;rows=0\" target=\"_blank\">12446 peer reviews</a> in the dedicated content type (and schema) we rolled out last November. PeerJ (10.7287) with <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.7287/works?filter=type:peer-review\" target=\"_blank\">12015</a> at time of writing and Stichting SciPost (10.21468) with <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.21468/works?filter=type:peer-review\" target=\"_blank\">297 works</a>. ScienceOpen (10.14293) has registered <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.14293/works?filter=type:peer-review\" target=\"_blank\">126 reviews</a> of papers on their post-publication platform.</p>\n<p>The peer review metadata collected is partly similar, though otherwise unique to other content. In the former, general metadata that we accept for the articles, as well as the reviews, include an ORCID iD to identify the reviewer, editor, and/or author <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/types/peer-review/works?filter=has-orcid:true&amp;facet=publisher-name:*&amp;rows=0\" target=\"_blank\">0</a>; license <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/types/peer-review/works?filter=has-license:true&amp;facet=publisher-name:*&amp;rows=0\" target=\"_blank\">0</a>.\nThis metadata is quite distinct from the article and is important to collect, not only as a discrete publication in its own right, but also to provide richer context for the actual results shared in the associated article. They are authored by different people than the paper’s contributors (author response/rebuttal excepting). They need not have the same license.</p>\n<p>Currently, none of this data has been registered. (From the publishers we’ve talked to, this is largely due to factors related to limitations in their technology systems.) And like other content types, we link up scholarly materials in the metadata and fill in the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-research-nexus-better-research-through-better-metadata/\">research nexus graph</a> through relations.</p>\n<p>There’s no better way to understand peer review metadata than to look at real examples from our members:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PeerJ review (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.2707v0.1/reviews/1\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.2707v0.1/reviews/1</a>) and its metadata (<a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.7287/peerj.2707v0.1/reviews/1\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/works/10.7287/peerj.2707v0.1/reviews/1</a>)</li>\n<li>ScienceOpen review (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14293/s2199-1006.1.sor-uncat.a5995373.v1.rhrmgu\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.14293/s2199-1006.1.sor-uncat.a5995373.v1.rhrmgu</a>) and its metadata (<a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.14293/s2199-1006.1.sor-uncat.a5995373.v1.rhrmgu\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/works/10.14293/s2199-1006.1.sor-uncat.a5995373.v1.rhrmgu</a>)</li>\n<li>SciPost review (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21468/scipost.report.10\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.21468/scipost.report.10</a>) and its metadata (<a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/works/10.21468/scipost.report.10\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/works/10.21468/scipost.report.10</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Review-specific metadata is also critical to capturing the shape of the scholarly discussion.

The more metadata, the bolder the story. We have created a set of reference metadata (fictitious) to illustrate this phenomenon. Josiah Carberry submits a manuscript to the Journal of Psychoceramics, entitled “Dog: A Methodology for the Development of Simulated Annealing.” It undergoes two rounds of review with two referees each round. The article <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681</a> is published and registered on May 6, 2012 along with the history of peer review materials on the same day:</p>\n<p>First submission</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Referee report 1 - <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9879\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9879</a></li>\n<li>Referee report 2 - <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9880\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9880</a></li>\n<li>Editor decision - <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9881\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9881</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Revision round 1</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Author rebuttal - <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9882\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9882</a></li>\n<li>Referee report 1 - <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9883\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9883</a></li>\n<li>Referee report 2 - <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9884\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9884</a></li>\n<li>Editor decision - <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9885\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345681.9885</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Published reviews can show peer feedback in progress; the progress of scholarly discussion unfolding, as expert ideas build upon each other.

These events are always free to attend, and whether you are a long-established member, totally new, or not even a member at all, we welcome you all to join us.</p>\n<p>At our most recent events we collaborated with some fantastic organizations and welcomed attendees from a variety of backgrounds including editors, publishers, service providers, researchers and other metadata users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-africa\">South Africa</h2>\n<p>In April <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/chuck-koscher/\">Chuck Koscher</a>, Director of Technology, and I travelled to South Africa for two LIVE locals, one in Pretoria and the other in Cape Town—and both in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.assaf.org.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAf)</a>. ASSAf also provided two excellent speakers, Nadine Wubbeling (ASSAf) and Pierre de Villiers (<a href=\"https://aosis.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">AOSIS</a>), who shared their experiences with Crossref and presented valuable insights into the work that they do.</p>\n<p>Delivering events for a varied audience like this means there are often differing levels of knowledge and experience. So, to make sure everyone benefited from our sessions, we covered the different ways you can work with the Crossref deposit system as an XML pro, or an absolute beginner. This included a live demonstration of our new deposit tool Metadata Manager (currently in beta) which should help those less technically-minded people (like myself), and be a big improvement upon our current web deposit form.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n|<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/dr-pierre.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Pierre de Villiers\" height=\"250px\" width=\"300px\"/>|<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/table-mountain2.jpg\" alt=\"Table Mountain\" height=\"250px\" width=\"300px\"/>|\n</div>\n<p>The day ended with a technical session, where attendees discussed specific issues they needed help with, which mainly focussed on retrieving metadata in the Crossref system, interpreting reports, and support with XML.</p>\n<p><em>Images left to right: Dr. Pierre de Villiers talks about the Crossref Experience at AOSIS, and the stunning scenery of Table Mountain provided a nice backdrop to our Cape Town event.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"russia\">Russia</h2>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just back from a few days in Russia 🇷🇺.

Fragen?</h2>\n<p>Over the course of these events we were asked many questions—and here are some of the more interesting/common ones posed to the team: <br></p>\n<p>Q. Do I have to join Crossref directly, or can I join as part of a group of smaller organizations? <br>\nA. You don’t have to be a direct member, you can join via a Sponsor. See our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/\">sponsors page</a> for a list of Sponsors in your area, and for more information on becoming a Sponsor.<br></p>\n<p>Q. Can I link translations of works together? <br>\nA. Yes, a journal article published in two languages can each be assigned its own DOI, and then linked in the metadata using the <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214357426\" target=\"_blank\">relationship type</a> <code>TranslationOf</code> from our schema.<br></p>\n<p>Q. Does the web deposit form support depositing abstracts and references?<br>\nA. No, it doesn’t. However, our new Metadata Manager tool does and if you are in interested in trying it out in beta, <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">let us know</a>.<br></p>\n<p>Q. Can I share your new Participation Report tool with my colleagues?<br>\nA. Yes you can! It’s open and available for use, just come along and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\" target=\"_blank\">search for a member</a>.<br></p>\n<p>Q. Can I also register book chapters, dissertations and other content types under the same prefix?<br>\nA. Yes you can. You can register any of the different <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213123586-Metadata-and-content-type-overview\" target=\"_blank\">content types we support</a> under one prefix.<br></p>\n<p>Q. Will you be doing more events in this region in future?<br>\nA.

My goal is to fill the very large shoes left by Patricia Feeney moving into the Head of Metadata role. I know Patricia knows Crossref and the rich community of members (and metadata!) inside and out. I’ll get there too. For now, I have immersed myself in tackling as many of your support questions as possible, so I may have already met some of you on a support ticket. If so, thanks for your patience; you likely have already taught me a thing or two!</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/isaac.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac, on the lookout to provide you excellent support\" height=\"250px\" width=\"250px\" />\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">Isaac, on the lookout to provide you excellent support</p>\n<p>I came to this position from one of our members – the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, where I served as the Digital Publications Manager for the last five years. Like many of you, I was always impressed, intrigued, and excited by the work underway at Crossref and wanted to be a part of the team. So, here I am, very much looking forward to the challenge ahead.</p>\n<p>I work remotely from Tulsa, Oklahoma, where I live with my wife and two daughters. Tulsa doesn’t have as many members as D.C., London, or Jakarta, but I hope to meet some of you during outreach trips, LIVE events, online in a webinar, or in our support community.</p>\n<p>One of the things that attracts me to being a part of this community are our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/truths/\">truths</a>. As a quick reminder, the truths are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Come one, come all</li>\n<li>One member, one vote</li>\n<li>Smart alone, brilliant together</li>\n<li>Love metadata, love technology</li>\n<li>What you see, what you get</li>\n<li>Here today, here tomorrow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am drawn to forward-thinking, action-oriented communities that value collaboration and openness. These truths, and the ten weeks I have been at Crossref, have confirmed that this is one of those communities. As your new support manager, I want to emphasize our commitment to transparency: Ask me anything; I’ll tell you what I know. In that spirit, I have the privilege of introducing our new status page—a key piece in furthering our own transparency and openness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://status.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">status.crossref.org</a></p>\n<p>Our new status page provides critical, real-time information about our services—it helps us tell our overall story. If you are looking for metrics on the performance of our APIs, websites, the deposit system, or new beta services, bookmark this page. The system metrics provide daily, weekly, and monthly overviews of each of our services’ response time (in milliseconds) and uptime, or percentage of time that service has been operational during your selected time span (daily, weekly, or monthly).</p>\n<p>From this page, we’ll announce planned maintenance and keep you regularly updated when we have an incident.

They talk about the work they’re doing, the collaborative approach, and how Dimensions uses the Crossref REST API as part of our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/\">Metadata Plus service</a>, to augment other data and their workflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-dimensions\">Introducing Dimensions</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication\" target=\"_blank\">Dimensions</a> is a next-generation approach to discovering, connecting with and contextualising research. Modern academics need data about the research ecosystem in which they exist as much as the administrators who develop institutional research strategies. All academics are now required to think long-range about their research projects, contextualise their research, and demonstrate the impact of their program. Additionally, they need to find funding, ensure that students go on to good positions, and hire talented colleagues whose skills fit well with ongoing projects. Dimensions gives the first fully-linked view of publications, grants, patents and clinical trials in an analytically-centred user experience.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/dimensions-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Dimensions sample screen\" width=\"100%\" />\n<h3 id=\"how-is-crossref-data-used-within-dimensions\">How is Crossref data used within Dimensions?</h3>\n<p>For an article to appear in Dimensions it must have a Crossref DOI, so it would not be possible to create Dimensions’ Publication index without Crossref’s data. Dimensions is built on several principles that we’ve talked about before. Here the most relevant of those principles are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unique identifiers should underlie everything that we do;</li>\n<li>data should not be inclusive and the tool should allow the user to select what they want to see;</li>\n<li>data should be more available to our community;</li>\n<li>data should be presented with as much contextual information as possible;</li>\n<li>the community should have enough data available to be able to create and experiment with their own metrics and indicators.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the context of these principles, Crossref makes a perfect starting place to create a tool like Dimensions. We use the Crossref data to know about our possible “universe” of articles. We then enhance the Crossref core with data from several different places: open access publications in the DOAJ, PubMed, BioArXiv, and through relationships with publishers. In all, 60 million of the 95 million articles in the Dimensions index have a full text version that we can text and data mine for additional information.</p>\n<p>In Dimensions’ enhancement stage we can extract address information (where not included in the original Crossref record) and map it to <a href=\"https://grid.ac/\" target=\"_blank\">GRID</a> funding information and the list of funders in Crossref’s Funder Registry as well as to our database of grants in Dimensions.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/dimensions-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"Extracting information with Dimensions\" width=\"100%\" />\n<h3 id=\"how-have-you-incorporated-citation-data\">How have you incorporated citation data?</h3>\n<p>Access to citations has historically been a thorny issue for citations databases. However, <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">I4OC</a> celebrated its first anniversary in April this year and this project has been a key driver in helping us to build Dimensions with the level of citation coverage that we managed –– it is a fantastic enabling initiative and should be warmly welcomed by the sector. Crossref is not the only source we were able to use to gather citation data; some text mining was needed to get a full graph. Dimensions goes beyond inter-article citations and includes links between patents and publications, links between clinical trials and publications, and Altmetric mentions of publications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-dimensions-openly-available\">Is Dimensions openly available?</h3>\n<p>Given that there is so much open data in Dimensions, it was always our intention to give a free version to the community. If you visit <a href=\"https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication\" target=\"_blank\">http://app.dimensions.ai</a> then you’ll be able to play with the system and use it for your research. While only the publications index is fully open, when you see a link to a grant, patent or clinical trial in an article detail page, you’ll be able to navigate to that record so that you can see the full context of the data.</p>\n<p>Beyond the ability to link the publications, Dimensions also displays the CV information which the researcher made visible publicly.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/dimensions-4-1.jpg\" alt=\"orcid record\" width=\"80%\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>Most recently, we’ve integrated ORCID into Dimensions. This means that you can push data from Dimensions into ORCID if you connect your ORCID account to your Dimensions account.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/dimensions-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"CV information\" width=\"80%\" lass=\"img-responsive\" />\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-future-plans-for-dimensions\">What are the future plans for Dimensions?</h3>\n<p>Dimensions is still moving quickly and adding more functionality. Our aim is to release more data facets very soon. We plan to add a Policy Document archive and a Research Data archive. We’ve already found some fascinating insights from joining the existing data together and these two new archives should add even more interesting data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-else-would-dimensions-like-to-see-in-crossref-metadata\">What else would Dimensions like to see in Crossref metadata?</h3>\n<p>Open access information is something that we work with <a href=\"https://unpaywall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Unpaywall</a> to source for Dimensions right now. It would be great if Crossref and Unpaywall could work together to make this data higher quality and more ubiquitous.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thank you Daniel, Christian and Simon.</p>\n<p>If you would like to contribute a case study on the uses of Crossref Metadata APIs please contact the <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">Community team</a>.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Meet the members, Part 3 (with INASP)","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/meet-the-members-part-3-with-inasp/","published":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Next in our Meet the members blog series is INASP, who isn’t a direct member, but acts as a Sponsor for hundreds of members.

We have a vision of research and knowledge at the heart of development, so are working to support individuals and institutions to produce, share and use research and knowledge, which can transform lives.</p>\n<p>Our work includes strengthening research communication, which we do via AuthorAID (supporting researchers, especially early-career researchers, in getting their research published); improving information access (supporting library consortia with access to international journals and other online resources); supporting evidence use in policy making; working with higher-education institutions to improve critical thinking skills; improving gender equity in research systems; and my area, which I’ll talk more about below, supporting academic publishing in the Global South.</p>\n<p>INASP’s approaches are based on the core pillars of capacity development, convening, influencing and working in partnership. INASP promotes equity by actively addressing the needs of both men and women across all our work and addressing issues of power within the research and knowledge system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-your-role-within-inasp\">What’s your role within INASP?</h3>\n<p>I’m a Programme Specialist and since I started at INASP 15 years ago I’ve been responsible for our <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220629190912/https://www.inasp.info/theme/academic-publishing\" target=\"_blank\">academic publishing work</a>. This work supports increased visibility, accessibility and quality of peer-reviewed journals published in developing countries so that the research outputs that are produced in these countries can be found, shared and used more effectively.</p>\n<p>We recognize two big challenges for Southern journals in playing their part in global research systems. The first is awareness of Southern journals, many of which were until recently only available in print. Supporting editors and national organizations to put their journals online on central platforms (the Journals Online platforms) has helped increase their visibility.</p>\n<p>We have also provided support to the local management teams in communicating about the platforms, the journals and the research they publish, and we recently published a Handbook for Journal Editors - <a href=\"https://www.inasp.info/editorshandbook\" target=\"_blank\">www.inasp.info/editorshandbook</a>. This is intended to be a free resource for editors worldwide that can be used as a stand-alone handbook or as an accompaniment to the journal quality online course that we are currently developing.</p>\n<p>The second challenge is supporting publishing quality and enabling Southern journals to demonstrate their quality so they will be regarded as credible. In the early days, this, for me, was largely about providing training and mentoring for journal editors and Journals Online platform managers about standard publishing practices.</p>\n<p>More recently, as local handover progressed, our role shifted towards helping journals to demonstrate their credibility. Last September INASP and African Journals Online launched our Journal Publishing Practices and Standards (JPPS) <a href=\"https://www.journalquality.info/en/\" target=\"_blank\">framework</a> for assessing the quality of Southern publishing processes. This has been really well received by the international publishing sector and by the journal editors we work with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tell-us-a-bit-about-who-you-support-and-how-you-support-them\">Tell us a bit about who you support, and how you support them</h3>\n<p>We support others communicating their research and finding out about the research of others.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The five Journals Online platforms that were handed over to local management at the end of March collectively host 397 journals from Bangladesh, El Salvador, Honduras, Mongolia, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sri Lanka.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These platforms help the research from these countries to become even more integrated in the global research community. Some fascinating and valuable research is published in the journals on these platforms. You can see some <a href=\"https://www.inasp.info/publications/helping-southern-research-reach-global-audience\" target=\"_blank\">examples</a> of this research in this article about a small piece of work we did with these platforms to commission and disseminate press releases of some of the research.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-your-participation-level-with-crossref\">What’s your participation level with Crossref?</h3>\n<p>INASP has been a Crossref Sponsor for the Journals Online platforms since 2008 and all articles on the sites have DOIs assigned to them (approximately 50,000 articles). All the in-country training sessions for journal editors publishing via the JOL platforms have included sessions to explain how DOIs work and why they are important. We have also trained editors on how to find and include the DOIs for the references of their articles. More recently, in 2015, we provided access to the Crossref Similarity Check service to editors, which enabled them to improve the quality of their submissions by identifying instances of plagiarism before the articles were published.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-trends-are-you-seeing-in-your-part-of-the-scholarly-communications-community\">What trends are you seeing in your part of the scholarly communications community?</h3>\n<p>Demonstrating credibility of journals is an important part of journal publishing today. There are so many journals worldwide and it is a tough challenge for authors and readers to navigate this sector – a challenge that we often see through the discussions in our AuthorAID network. But it is important that researchers don’t simply turn to the handful of well-known publishers in the Global North that have dominated scholarly discourse to date.</p>\n<p>To really tackle global issues and increase equality in global research we need to work towards levelling the playing field and including all voices – and this challenge needs to be embraced across the global research and knowledge system. We have seen encouraging signs over the past couple of years of magazines, blogs, conference organizers and industry groups in the Global North approaching us to help bring in more global perspectives to scholarly discussions. However, there is plenty more to be done and we are particularly focusing on equity in our new areas of work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-would-you-describe-the-value-of-being-a-crossref-sponsor\">How would you describe the value of being a Crossref Sponsor?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Collaboration with Crossref over the past few years has been one of a number of ways that we have been able to connect small, scholar-led titles in the Global South with the latest global standards and approaches in scholarly publishing. This is important as it all helps to level the playing field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Including DOIs in papers is one of the criteria for being awarded a JPPS star and thus the journals are incentivized to understand and use them more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-inasps-plans-for-the-future\">What are INASP’s plans for the future?</h3>\n<p>INASP has recently completed a major five-year programme of work with a significant focus on strengthening organizations in the countries we have been working in and handing over responsibility for managing things like the Journals Online platforms. We are now in a new phase of work, building on what has gone before but with a particular emphasis on improving equity both within and between research systems.</p>\n<p>Many challenges remain – the global research system still tends to be biased towards the Global North. From an academic publishing perspective this is apparent both in terms of awareness of journals and also in terms of impressions of credibility. JPPS is intended to tackle the latter challenge but it is still early days – we only announced the first badges awarded a few months ago. Over the next few years we will be building on and strengthening this work and ensuring that it is an important part of the processes for journal editors and for authors and readers.</p>\n<p>Thank you Sioux for your participation in our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/meet-the-members/\">Meet the members</a> series.

Each check will come with information about why it is important and guidance on how to improve.

Unfortunately, very few other parties have adopted this practice.</p>\n<p>What’s more, because using a 303 redirect is still unusual, it tends to throw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\" target=\"_blank\">SEO</a> tools into a <a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/tizzy?s=t\" target=\"_blank\">tizzy</a>- and we spend a lot of time fielding SEO questions from our members about our use of 303s.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-nametldratldra\"><a name=\"tldr\"></a>TL;DR</a></h2>\n<p>At this point, we need to emphasise that we have never seen our use of 303s actually affect page rankings. But at the same time, use of 303 redirects has not had wider uptake. Maintaining this quixotic behaviour just isn’t worth the effort. We hope that, in the future, we can use other techniques (e.g. <a href=\"https://signposting.org/\" target=\"_blank\">signposting</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vandesompel-citeas/\" target=\"_blank\">cite-as</a>) to achieve some of the things that 303 was supposed to do.</p>\n<p>Note that these changes <strong>will not affect users or machines using DOIs</strong>. The change should be entirely transparent.</p>\n<p>Below we provide some background to our decision and after that we provide some detailed technical notes from <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7694-8250\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Rees</a> and <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5490-1347\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Thompson</a> who have been very kind in helping to provide Crossref technical guidance on how we can help DOIs best support linked open data and adhere to HTTP best practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-namebackgroundbackgrounda\"><a name=\"background\">Background</a></h2>\n<p>Back in 2010, Crossref, DataCite (and later, several other RAs) responded to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/doi-what-do-we-got/\">concerns that DOIs were not &ldquo;linked-data friendly.&rdquo;</a> There were three problems with DOIs at that time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was not clear that DOIs could be used and expressed as HTTP URIs.</li>\n<li>There was no standard way to ask a DOI to return a machine-readable representation of the data.</li>\n<li>It wasn’t always clear if the DOI resolved to &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; (e.g. an article) or “something about the thing” (e.g. a landing page).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On the advice of several people in the linked data community, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/dois-and-linked-data-some-concrete-proposals/\">we proposed some options for fixing this</a>. And we finally settled on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recommending that Crossref DOIs be expressed and displayed as HTTP (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/5jchdy\" target=\"_blank\">now HTTPS</a>) URIs. This made it clear that DOIs could be used with HTTP applications.</li>\n<li>Enabling DOI registration agencies to support content negotiation. This allowed RAs to support providing machine-readable representations of the data associated with a DOI.</li>\n<li>Changing the underlying redirect code from the normal 302 to 303. This was designed to clarify what, at the time, was true- that most DOIs resolved to a landing page, not the article itself.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By any practical measure, machine use of DOIs has exploded since we made these decisions back in 2010. Crossref’s APIs and content negotiation handle over 800 million requests for machine readable data a month. Our sibling organisation, <a href=\"https://www.datacite.org\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite</a>, has also seen a huge growth in machine use of DOIs. Many applications, from bibliographic management tools, to authoring systems and CRIS systems, make use of machine actionable DOIs all the time. So clearly our work to promote DOIs as machine actionable identifiers is working, but we are certain that our current use of 303 redirects has nothing to do with this growth.</p>\n<p>First of all, as we said, very few parties have actually subscribed to the notion of using 303s to help distinguish &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; from “something about the thing”.</p>\n<p>Secondly, even if they did try to rely on 303s to make this distinction, they would quickly get confused because the DOI is so often just the first in a chain of redirects which do not implement the same semantic distinction. At this point we should be clear - Crossref thinks these kinds of long redirect chains are a bad idea for two main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They slow down resolution.</li>\n<li>They increase the number of potential failure points between the DOI and the item it resolves to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But we also cannot legislate them away. They exist. And in the real world you will find plenty of DOIs that do a 303 redirect to a system that, in turn, does a 302 redirect to a system that does a 301 redirect and…eventually ends up someplace returning a 200. You get the picture. How on earth is a machine supposed to interpret a 303-&gt;302-&gt;301-&gt;302 redirect chain?</p>\n<p>Furthermore - nowadays, after following this chain of redirects, you will often find yourself on a &ldquo;page&rdquo; that is <em>both</em> a landing page <em>and</em> the article itself. Dynamic, one-page applications can simply morph the one into the other without the use of additional HTTP requests.</p>\n<p>In other words, using 303s is not helping machines interpret what the DOI is pointing at. And yet, people seem to be making good use of machine actionable DOIs and they are not complaining much about it.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’d might have just been happy to switch back to using 302s <em>simply</em> so that I could cut down on my conversations with SEO hacks. But that wouldn’t be a principled approach. In 2010 we spent a lot of time considering the initial switch to 303s- we needed to consult with the LOD community on a potential switch back to 302s. At the January 2018 <a href=\"https://pidapalooza.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PIDapalooza</a> I had a chance to talk to Henry Thomson about the 302/303 dilemma we faced, and he along with Jonathan Rees very generously provided the following feedback.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-namedetailsbest-practices-for-http-redirection-by-persistent-identifier-resolvers-302-vs-303a\"><a name=\"details\">Best practices for HTTP redirection by persistent identifier resolvers: 302 vs. 303</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Jonathan Rees (MIT CSAIL, <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7694-8250\" target=\"_blank\">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7694-8250</a>)</li>\n<li>Henry Thompson (University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics, <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5490-1347\" target=\"_blank\">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5490-1347</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If one goes to the trouble to organize an identifier system, then the desire that such a system should last as long as possible leads one to aspirationally say it’s a <em>persistent</em> identifier (PID) system. The unwillingness of the major browser suppliers to implement new URI schemes for PIDs initially hindered their use on the Web and this in turn inhibited widespread adoption. More recently a number of PID approaches have enjoyed very rapid growth as a result of a compromise: these PIDs participate in the World Wide Web by defining simple conversion rules mapping identifiers to <em>actionable</em> (&lsquo;http:&rsquo; and/or &lsquo;https:&rsquo;) forms and providing resolution servers that redirect requests for such forms to the appropriate destination.This approach has been widely adopted and is very successful, because it is so useful. An identifier’s actionable form leads, via the HTTP protocol and one or more redirections, to a web page that bears on the ground identity of the associated entity – or perhaps even directly to the entity itself, if the system is one for document entities that are naturally provided as web pages. The nature of the retrieved web page varies from one system to the next.</p>\n<p>A confusion arose, however, over claims in various technical specifications (<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986\" target=\"_blank\">URIs</a>, <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Architecture</a>) that the normal case is for the protocol to yield a &ldquo;representation&rdquo; of the “resource” “identified” by the URI. None of these terms is adequately defined by the specifications, and initially the language was not taken as normative. Those deploying identifier systems took the HTTP “resource” to be the entity associated with an identifier, and understood the “resource” as being “identified” by the URI, but it was never clear what was, or wasn’t, a “representation” of a given entity/resource: a description of the resource, the resource itself, a version of the resource, instructions on how to find the resource, etc. Sixteen years ago, in an attempt to clarify the intent of this part of the theory of URIs, and to allow applications to usefully and uniformly exploit the idea that an HTTP 200 response must deliver a “representation” of the “resource”, Tim Berners-Lee <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Mar/0092\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/\" target=\"_blank\">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> to consider what came to be known as the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/group/track/issues/14\" target=\"_blank\">httpRange-14</a> issue. It’s now 13 years after the TAG gave <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Jun/0039.html\" target=\"_blank\">advice</a> which almost no one was happy with, and 5 years after work on issue <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/group/track/issues/57\" target=\"_blank\">httpRedirections-57</a> (which superseded httpRange-14) ground to a halt. There’s still no consensus on whether it’s OK to return landing pages with a 200 status in response to requests for pictures or publications, but the Web seems to be working nonetheless, and no one seems to be bothered much anymore.</p>\n<p>The provision of HTTP-based resolution services has stimulated widespread support for the use of identifier systems with Web resolution, particularly in the scholarly journal publication context. Those setting up HTTP resolvers responsible for identifier systems must decide which HTTP response code should be used. The TAG’s advice sows doubt on the use of the 200 response code when the response would have been a landing page, and many resolvers avoid 200 regardless and use redirection for administrative purposes, for example</p>\n<p>‘<a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/5.771073\" target=\"_blank\">https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/5.771073</a>’ to</p>\n<p>‘<a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/771073/?reload=true\" target=\"_blank\">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/771073/?reload=true</a>’ for the DOI</p>\n<p>‘10.1109/5.771073’, or ‘<a href=\"https://identifiers.org/uniprot/A0A022YWF9\" target=\"_blank\">https://identifiers.org/uniprot/A0A022YWF9</a>’ to</p>\n<p>‘<a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A0A022YWF9\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A0A022YWF9</a>’ for the Uniprot identifier</p>\n<p>‘A0A022YWF9’.</p>\n<p>So the response should be a redirection, but what kind, 301, 302, or 303? (Or 307, which is almost the same as 302.) A 301 redirect seems to say that the URI is not persistent (since its target is deemed &ldquo;more persistent&rdquo;). A 302 redirect seems to say that the response could have come via a 200, and so suffers the same fate as 200. That leaves 303, as hinted at in the TAG’s advice. This idea got some traction: Ten years ago a Semantic Web interest group promoted the TAG’s advice in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/\" target=\"_blank\">a published note</a>, and seven years ago one of us wrote a <a href=\"https://odontomachus.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/crossrefs-gift-of-metadata/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> giving the same advice for resolvers for PIDs in publishing.</p>\n<p>However, not only is there neither consensus nor general utility around this strict understanding of the use of the various response codes – that is, that resolution to a landing page is inconsistent with a 200 (and <em>a posteriori</em> therefore with a 302) – but also the range of usage patterns for redirection of HTTP requests has grown and ramified over time as the Web has grown and become more complex. It’s on the face of it unlikely that a mere three response codes can capture all the resulting complexity or cover the space of outcomes (in terms of e.g. what ends up in the browser address bar or what search engines index a page under) that a page owner might like to signal.</p>\n<p>We find in practice that some PID redirections <em>are</em> ending up (usually after further publisher-local redirects) at the &ldquo;identified&rdquo; document, some at landing pages, and some at one <em>or</em> the other depending on the requesting site, for example in the case of paywalled material.</p>\n<p>In the absence of a rethinking of the whole 3xx space, it seems to us that only the 301 vs. 302 distinct ion (roughly, 301 = permanent = please fix the link, and 302 = temporary = don’t change the link) is well understood and more or less consistently treated, whereas for 303, web servers are not very consistent and both <a href=\"http://sharkseo.com/nohat/303-redirects-seo/\" target=\"_blank\">search engine</a> and citation crawler behaviours are at best inconsistent and at worst downright unhelpful.</p>\n<p>So, we believe it is in both users’ and publishers’ interests for resolvers of actionable-form PIDs to use 302 redirects, not 303.</p>\n<p>If we want to help machines better understand the resource that a DOI points at, we have to explore using more nuanced mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Just using 302 for the first redirect doesn&rsquo;t do everything necessary to effectively support the emerging PID+redirection architecture. It&rsquo;s at the <em>end</em> of the redirect chains that we need more: a standardised way to find the PID back at the start of the chain. The <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vandesompel-citeas/\" target=\"_blank\">&lsquo;cite-as&rsquo; proposal</a> does exactly this, and we hope it&rsquo;s quickly approved and widely adopted. Once <em>that</em> happens a proposal for augmenting browser (and API) behaviour to prefer, or at least offer, the &lsquo;cite-as&rsquo; link for bookmarking and copying will be needed.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Using the Crossref REST API.

Researchers have reported around 2.5 million attributed outcomes in Researchfish and roughly half of these are publications with the other half being collaborations, further funding, data sets, policy influences, engagement activities etc.</p>\n<p>Funders use Researchfish to ask grantees to report on the outcomes of their grant and Researchfish makes it easy for researchers to do this in a structured way. Researchfish seeks to improve the quality and robustness of the evidence base available for evaluation.

Here Alex provides some background to the work and asks for input from the community:</em></p>\n<p>Roughly one year ago, Crossref and DataCite <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/taking-the-con-out-of-conferences\">started</a> a working group on conference and project identifiers. With this blog post, we would like to share the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1URIvkUpzcfjSd2YFIS-rdRIrOyrKSbFfhkdpGPRTAFI/edit\" target=\"_blank\">specification</a> of conference metadata and Crossmark for proceedings and are inviting the broader community to comment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-are-conferences-important\">Why are conferences important?</h3>\n<p>One common misbelief is that most published research appears in journals. However, next to new ways of communication research results (blogs, presentations,…) and journals there are also other publication options, like books, very important in humanities, or conference proceedings, which are very important in computer science and a couple of related disciplines. Conference proceedings are collections of journal-like papers, often undergoing a more competitive peer review process than in journals. For instance, looking at original research in computer science in Scopus published in CS in 2012-2016, 63% of articles appeared in proceedings, while only 37% were published in journals. <a href=\"http://dblp.uni-trier.de/statistics/distributionofpublicationtype\" target=\"_blank\">DBLP</a>, one of the most important indexing services in CS, lists more than two million conference papers organized in ~5,400 conference series.</p>\n<p>So, while it is true that CS has a significant share of conference proceedings, conferences are also relevant in many other disciplines which do not publish formal proceedings. For instance, <a href=\"http://inspirehep.net/\" target=\"_blank\">inSPIRE</a> contains ~23,000 conferences in high-energy physics, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) publishes roughly 100 <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180203164329/http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/conferenceproceedings.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">proceedings</a> volumes annually.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-do-we-need-an-open-persistent-id-for-a-conference-or-a-conference-series\">Why do we need an open persistent ID for a conference or a conference series?</h3>\n<p>With publishers, learned societies, indexing services, libraries, conference management systems, research evaluation and funding agencies using conferences directly or indirectly in their daily work, a common vocabulary would simplify data processing, reporting and minimize errors. Right now, a publisher assigns a unique conference ID to the conference to be published, then an indexing service does it, then it is assigned in a library. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to do this at the very beginning of the process, when the conference planning starts, and keep the same identifier through the whole conference lifecycle?</p>\n<p>The joint Crossref and DataCite group on conference and project identifiers has discussed this topic at half a dozen calls and various PID community meetings (PIDapalooza, FORCE conferences, AAHEP Information Provider Summit). The result of those discussions is a draft of the specification of conference metadata and Crossmark for proceedings.</p>\n<p>The document first defines the concepts of a conference, conference series, joint and co-located conferences. It then introduces the information we want to store about those entities, e.g., the ID, name, acronym, other IDs, URL and the maintainer of the conference series, or the ID, conf series ID, number, dates, location, and URL for conferences. Such metadata can be submitted to Crossref and DataCite by conference organizers or publishers on their behalf and linked to the existing proceedings metadata, where appropriate. It can be then used for linking research outputs from a conference (beyond formal proceedings), recognizing reviewers via services such as ORCID and Publons, computing metrics of a conference series, conference disambiguation in indexing services and ratings (CORE, QUALIS, CCF), and so on.</p>\n<p>The second part of the document introduces Crossmark for conference proceedings.

We hear you.</h2>\n<p>We’ve spent the past year building Crossref Event Data, and hope to launch very soon. Building a new piece of infrastructure from scratch has been an exciting project, and we’ve taken the opportunity to incorporate as much feedback from the community as possible. We’d like to take a moment to share some of the suggestions we had, and how we’ve acted on them.</p>\n<p>We asked a focus group “<strong>What one thing would you change?</strong>”. In hindsight, we could have done a better job with the question. We did get some enlightening answers but&mdash;for legal and practical reasons&mdash;we are unable to end either world hunger or global conflict, or do any of the other things we were invited to do. So we went back to our focus group and asked “What one thing would you change <em>about Crossref</em>?”.</p>\n<p>The answers were illuminating. Some of you wanted mundane things like more data dumps. A disappointing number of people wanted us to put the capital ‘R’ back in our name. But two things we heard consistently, loud and clear, were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“I want to hear more from Crossref”</li>\n<li>“I want to know more about what’s going on inside Crossref”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One respondent said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I like the newsletters, and the Twitter visuals are nice enough, but I want to hear, you know, <em>more</em> from them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Crossref is your typical quiet DOI Registration Agency. They make a big thing about being the background infrastructure you don’t notice. But infrastructure doesn’t have to be quiet. I live next to the M25, and I can tell you, that’s the sound of success. I mean, it’s loud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One final quote which clinched it for us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The outreach team is doing a great job with their multilingual videos. But you can never cover every world language. In today’s connected world, you should be thinking about the <em>universal language</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She clarified:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, I don’t mean XML.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We took this advice to heart. When we were building Crossref Event Data, we baked these features right in. Now you can hear what’s going on inside Crossref, any time, day or night.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-the-crossref-thing-action-service\">Introducing the Crossref Thing Action Service!</h2>\n<p>Turn up your speakers (about half-way, it would be foolhardy to turn them too high) and visit:</p>\n<h3 id=\"liveeventdatacrossreforgthing-action-servicehtmlhttpsliveeventdatacrossreforgthing-action-servicehtml\"><a href=\"https://live.eventdata.crossref.org/thing-action-service.html\" target=\"_blank\">live.eventdata.crossref.org/thing-action-service.html</a></h3>\n<p>It’s optimized for Google Chrome, but we’ve tested it in Firefox and Safari.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Thing Action Service</strong> shows you, in excruciating sonorous detail, every single action that happens inside the Crossref Event Data system. Every time we receive live data from Twitter or Wikipedia. Every time we check a DOI. Every time we check an RSS feed. Every time we find a link to our Registered Content on the web.</p>\n<p>In a pioneering move within the scholarly publishing space, you can hear the data as it’s being processed, live. Furthermore, we think we are the first DOI Registration Agency to offer our services in stereo.</p>\n<p>John Chodacki, Professional Working Group Chair, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We welcome this innovation. From my experience Chairing, well, everything, I’m certain that hearing-impaired users will like it especially.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So sit back, put the Thing Action Service on the speakers, and relax. You may find it difficult at first, but as you let the sound waves wash over you, think of all that data in flight. That beep could be someone criticizing the article you wrote on Twitter. But don’t worry, the next one might be someone defending it.</p>\n<p>Think of it as <em>musique concrète</em>. That’s the Art of Persistence.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Hello, meet Event Data Version 1, and new Product Manager","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/hello-meet-event-data-version-1-and-new-product-manager/","published":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"I joined Crossref only a few weeks ago, and have happily thrown myself into the world of Event Data as the service’s new product manager.

In my first week, a lot of time was spent discussing the ins and outs of Event Data. This learning process made me very much feel like you might when you’ve just bought a house, and you’re studying the blueprints while also planning the house-warming party.</p>\n<p>If Event Data is like a house, it’s been built and we’ve recently been putting on a last coat of paint. We’re very happy to announce version 1 of the API today. This is bringing us closer to the launch (house warming party), which will officially present Event Data to the world. Further to that analogy, while I bought into the house, I wasn’t around to see it being built. That’s both incredibly exciting and a little daunting.</p>\n<p>Version 1 contains fixes for some challenges we came up against. Like scalability, data modeling for Wikipedia, and polishing. Version 1 is a new release of the data, but it is the same data set you already know and love. It should solve some of the recent stability issues, for which we apologize.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, we expect the data model in V1 to persist and are not planning to make further large scale, fundamental changes to the Event Data API. As such, the version 1 release of the API is exceptional and a big step forward. It is important that we address these fixes before we go into production as it affects everyone who uses the service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"same-event-data-new-address\">Same Event Data, new address</h2>\n<p>In setting up for the upcoming production service rollout, we have updated the Event Data API domain so that it is in line with Crossref’s suite of APIs. The Query API can now be found at a new URL. Here is an example query: <a href=\"https://api.eventdata.crossref.org/v1/events?rows=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.eventdata.crossref.org/v1/events?rows=1</a></p>\n<p>We have also simplified the standard query parameters in favor of a cleaner filter syntax.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we have added a new “Mailto” parameter, <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#etiquette\" target=\"_blank\">just like in our REST API</a>. It is encouraged but optional, so you are not obliged to supply it. We&rsquo;ll only use it to contact you if there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changes-to-the-wikipedia-data-structure\">Changes to the Wikipedia data structure</h2>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work to use the <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/data/ids-and-urls/\" target=\"_blank\">canonical URLs</a> for web pages to represent content as consistently as possible. This has entailed updating previously collected Events across data sources. As such, we’ve updated our Wikipedia data model to align with this. Because this update has impacted every Wikipedia Event in the system, we recommend those who have used or saved existing data from the deprecated Query API version to pull a new copy of the data. Read more about <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/crossref-event-data-beta-testers/-RAzhr7SIHY\" target=\"_blank\">the rationale for changing the Wikipedia data model</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updated-data\">Updated data</h2>\n<p>This then brings me to how we now handle updated data. Sometimes we edit Events to add new features, or we may edit Events if there is an issue processing and/or representing the data when we provision it to the community. And sometimes we must remove Events to comply with a particular data source’s terms and conditions (ex: deleted Tweets). You can read about how updates work in <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/data/updates/\" target=\"_blank\">the user guide</a>.</p>\n<p>To make life easier moving forward, we’ve split updated Events into two API endpoints.\nIf you are already using Event Data, you will need to make some small updates to your client(s) to align with this. The new endpoints are further described <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/service/query-api/\" target=\"_blank\">in the documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"event-data-beta-group\">Event Data beta group</h2>\n<p>With the version 1 release we are making solid progress towards an official launch (the house-warming party!), we are quite excited to <a href=\"mailto:eventdata@crossref.org\">hear how you are using Event Data</a>.

The term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustrum\" target=\"_blank\">“lustrum”</a> designated not only the animal sacrifice (“suovetaurilia”) but was also applied to the period of time itself. At Crossref, we’re not exactly in the business of sacrificial rituals. But over the weekend I thought it would be fun to dive into the metadata and look at very high level changes during this period of time.</p>\n<p>Crossref provides the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/dashboard\">latest cumulative stats online</a>. We share news about the work we do along the way in the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog\">Crossref blog</a>, including periodic summaries such as the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-year-in-the-life-of-crossref\">Executive Director’s 2017 end-of-year highlights</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/annual-report\">annual review</a>. But what follows is a brief and very informal survey of the population of inhabitants in the Crossref metadata-land for the current lustrum.</p>\n<h3 id=\"works-published\">Works published</h3>\n<p>The first thing a census typically asks is population size. We know there are new records arriving each month with 95.7mil to date. And they do so at variable rates. But when the data is visualized, a rough yearly pattern emerges into view. (Data were collected on Mar 25, 2018; results are partial for this month.)</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Jen blog chart.png\" alt=\"works published by month\" height=\"400px\" width=\"650px\" />\n</p>\n<p>Each year brings with it a significant spike, an influx of new entrants, perhaps reflecting an increase in submissions at the end of the previous year. After January, volume drops down dramatically and gradually rises once more over the course of the year. We see smaller spikes at the March, June, and September mark. (Since this was a brief exercise, I did not dive into any formal research conducted on the nature of publishing cycles.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"metadata-coverage\">Metadata Coverage</h3>\n<p>The next question is a look at how the population is broken up into different demographics. For this, I analyzed four key sub-populations of ORCID, funding information, license, abstract metadata. The following graph shows the percentage of new parties (i.e., works registered at Crossref containing these metadata) across four specific segments.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/metadata coverage.png\" alt=\"Crossref metadata coverage\" height=\"750px\" width=\"650px\" />\n</p>\n<p>I ran <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/karthik/7e7875af0ecaa4327d3d61f550de94e0\" target=\"_blank\">Karthik Ram’s script</a> which employed <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref\" target=\"_blank\">rOpenSci’s r client</a> for the <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref REST API</a>. Data are based on publication date rather than deposit date and represent all updates to the metadata record for the baseline view.</p>\n<p>The census graph shows extensive empty space on the top half, indicating there is ample room for continual growth in these communities. The ORCID population is expanding the fastest, followed by license and funding. Abstracts are a minority group and quite visibly needs a population boost here in Crossref-land.</p>\n<p>This view does not capture the percentages across content types nor does it take into account the differential rate of growth between content types (e.g., journal article, book, report, conference proceeding, dissertation, dataset, component, posted content, peer review) as the Crossref corpus has grown. While ORCID, funding, and license information are available for all full content types (viz., excludes components), this matters for abstracts. Abstracts are part of the metadata schema of all relevant content types. This excludes those which do not apply: dataset, component, and peer reviews. All things considered though, the relative impact on the total percentage of metadata deposited (or not deposited) is miniscule given the small sums for these works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calling-the-real-demographers--cartographers\">Calling the real demographers &amp; cartographers</h3>\n<p>This mini-pseudo-lustrum was the result of a few hours of play. The graphs have raised more questions than answers. We welcome more serious and earnest efforts to dive into the metadata and conduct a more detailed, reliable investigation on the size, distribution and composition of the population through our <a href=\"http://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a>. Next month, we will roll out reports on metadata coverage based on individual members.</p>\n<p>This “play” census came out of a session with Karthik Ram, one of the founders of <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/\" target=\"_blank\">rOpenSci</a>, as we talked about struggle to build better tools for researchers. (rOpenSci is an exciting and influential non-profit that builds open source software for research with a community of users and developers and educates scientists about transparent research practices.) With each round of cocktails, it became clear that a critical subset of the issues boiled down to the problem of limited information about research publications. Why, that is what Crossref does! Indeed. Publishers register their content with Crossref and provide the metadata about the works they publish.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have been working with our members to broaden the coverage of the metadata as well as improve their metadata quality. This issue is not exclusive to Crossref - <a href=\"http://www.metadata2020.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata 2020</a> rallies stakeholders across the research enterprise to push for change together.</p>\n<p>To represent the full breadth and depth of the scholarly communications enterprise, Crossref aims to capture the richness of what our members publish through the content they register. So publishers, powerfully represent your services and make sure <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/\">your metadata is complete and correct</a> for discovery systems, indexing platforms, research evaluation systems, analytics tools, and the great number of Crossref metadata consumers far and wide.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"How we use Crossref metadata","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/how-we-use-crossref-metadata/","published":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Bruce Rosenblum, CEO, Inera Incorporated talks about the work they are doing at Inera, and how they’re using our metadata as part of their workflow.

At Inera I help scholarly and technical publishers improve their workflows through technology, and build editorial and XML software solutions to improve the publication workflow. I lead the development teams for our eXtyles and Edifix products, and I also participate in community projects: co-authoring the original NLM DTD suite, developing the Crossref Metadata Deposit Schema in 2001, and serving for 8 years on the NISO board. I continue to work on JATS and BITS development, and I co-chair the NISO STS Working Group. Before joining Inera, I developed publishing technology such as an Apple II Word processor for Chinese in 1981, and early micro-computer desktop publishing systems in the late 1980s.</p>\n<p>At Inera, we develop and license the eXtyles family of Word-based editorial and XML software tools (including eXtyles, eXtyles NLM, eXtyles STS, and eXtyles SI) as well as Edifix, an online bibliographic reference solution. eXtyles and Edifix allow users to automate the most time-consuming aspects of document publication. Publishers of scholarly journals and books, standards, and government documents around the world rely on our software solutions to drive efficient, effective publishing workflows.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Inera.png\" alt=“Inera logo\" height=\"200px\" width=\"250px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<p>Inera and Crossref have collaborated since 2001, and we jointly won the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161105110057/https://www.nepcoawards.com/2014-winner-videos.html\" target=\"_blank\">2014 NEPCo Award</a> for the ongoing symbiotic relationship between our organizations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-problem-is-your-software-and-service-trying-to-solve\">What problem is your software and service trying to solve?</h3>\n<p>Publishers receive manuscripts from authors who have deep knowledge of their subject matter but are sometimes not expert writers and rarely expert users of Microsoft Word. Our eXtyles and Edifix solutions are designed to help publishers rapidly and accurately prepare these manuscripts for publication by automating a lot of technical and editorial cleanup, then producing high-quality JATS and BITS XML.</p>\n<p>Within eXtyles and Edifix, we have sophisticated algorithms that heuristically parse bibliographic references, copyedit them automatically to a publisher’s editorial style, and then link them to Crossref and PubMed. These features eliminate a lot of repetitive detail copy editing work so that human editors can focus on higher-level editing tasks, and they produce more accurate bibliographies that include online links, with a fraction of the work that it would take to look up, check, and correct each reference manually.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-you-using-crossref-metadata-at-inera\">How are you using Crossref Metadata at Inera?</h3>\n<p>Simply stated, we use Crossref metadata in our products to ensure that bibliographic reference lists are as complete, correct, and up to date as possible at the point of publication.</p>\n<p>Both eXtyles and Edifix use Crossref metadata to improve reference lists. Our reference processing module pulls apart references to journal articles, books, book chapters, conference papers, and standards, applies elements based on the JATS reference model, and then reconstructs them according to the editorial style chosen by the user (e.g., AMA, APA, MLA, or a custom-configured style to meet customers’ requirements).</p>\n<p>Crossref metadata is used for two primary purposes. First, we query the Crossref database to obtain DOI links for journal articles, books, conferences, and other types of references. This link lookup helps our customers fulfill their Crossref membership obligations and helps ensure that researchers get appropriate credit for citations of their work. Second, we use the metadata obtained from Crossref to improve the accuracy of author-supplied reference entries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-values-do-you-pull-from-our-apis\">What values do you pull from our APIs?</h3>\n<p>The most important metadata value we retrieve is the DOI itself. Because the majority of bibliographic references in author manuscripts do not include DOIs, a key feature of our service is DOI retrieval. However, we use metadata well beyond the DOIs once we’ve matched a record. Even if a reference already has a DOI, we still do a traditional query, using the other available reference elements, to retrieve a DOI and compare the results to flag discrepancies. We’ve found that ~20% of author-supplied DOIs are incorrect, so correcting these discrepancies is one of myriad ways that our software uses Crossref metadata to improve references before publication.</p>\n<p>We also pull all of the other fields that are used to build a bibliographic reference—complete author list, title of the item, publication date, volume, pages, and so on—and use these elements to correct and improve the reference. By filling in missing data (e.g., volume, issue, and page numbers) and flagging discrepancies between author-supplied entries and Crossref metadata (e.g., author names in a different order, words missing or misspelled in an article or chapter title), our software assures publishers of a high-quality bibliography with minimal manual effort.</p>\n<p>Finally, we use Crossmark metadata to flag references that may have been corrected—or retracted—to inform editors when an item may need further attention from an author. Did the author knowingly cite a retracted article? If not, does that change the science of the paper citing that retracted item?</p>\n<h3 id=\"have-you-built-your-own-interface-to-extract-this-data\">Have you built your own interface to extract this data?</h3>\n<p>Yes, we’ve built our own tools to query Crossref’s APIs. In 2002, we used the old “piped-query” API to submit elements of journal references, but we outgrew this API because it returned too many false positive results and missed other DOIs that were correct, and because we wanted to query Crossref for DOIs to other reference types (e.g., books, conference papers, reports) as well as journals. We switched to XML queries in 2006, and the result was a huge improvement in the quality and quantity of DOI links for our customers.</p>\n<p>But just moving to XML queries still wasn’t good enough. Eight years ago, we wanted to improve DOI retrieval of non-journal items like reports, and we found that the existing Crossref APIs didn’t provide what we needed. So we collaborated with Crossref CTO Chuck Koscher to create the author–title query as an extension to regular XML queries. The result was a dramatic improvement in our ability to retrieve DOIs to non-journal items. The author–title query was a precursor to Crossref’s current metadata APIs, and it continues to serve us well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-often-do-you-extract-or-query-data\">How often do you extract or query data?</h3>\n<p>All the time! Our customers are located all around the world in more than 25 countries on six continents, so Crossref metadata queries from our software are happening continually, at any time of the day or night, seven days a week, and even on holidays.</p>\n<p>There are two other important ways that our software interacts with Crossref APIs every day. First, Crossref’s <a href=\"https://apps.crossref.org/simpleTextQuery\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Text Query</a> (STQ) service, which is used by smaller publishers to meet their Crossref requirement to add DOIs to their reference lists, was built using Inera’s reference parsing engine. In this case, our software runs on Crossref’s servers and is an integral part of the Crossref ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Second, to test our products, we run a comprehensive automated quality assurance process every night that tests all aspects of our software and ensures day-over-day stability. When we added Crossref linking functionality in 2003, we began running several thousand Crossref queries per night, looking for consistency in our software’s results. A few months later, we noted an unexpected change: a reference that had previously returned a DOI failed to link! We contacted Crossref about the “lost” DOI, and upon investigation, Crossref discovered that in the process of redepositing 20,000 DOIs, the publisher had accidentally inverted author surnames and given names in all of those records.</p>\n<p>Crossref immediately recognized the value of Inera’s automated testing, and its ability to unearth such errors, to Crossref and its members. Over time, the number of DOIs we test nightly has grown to tens of thousands, so we’ve worked with Crossref to develop an automated reporting and analysis process that makes detecting and resolving the issues highlighted by our internal testing more efficient.</p>\n<p>The co-development of the author–title query API and the sharing of our nightly test suite results are just two examples that highlight the nature of the Inera–Crossref relationship: it’s characterized by technology integration, bidirectional information exchange, and innovative problem solving.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-future-plans-for-inera\">What are the future plans for Inera?</h3>\n<p>We’re constantly working to improve eXtyles and Edifix and to develop new and innovative ways to help our customers. Here are a few examples:</p>\n<p>Two years ago, at the peak of the Zika outbreak, we received an urgent request from the World Health Organization to help them create DOIs for articles that had been submitted but not yet peer reviewed (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/zika_open/en/\" target=\"_blank\">see Zika Open</a>). Within 16 hours of their request, we developed, tested, and deployed updated software that allowed WHO to publish information vital to researchers, including DOIs, within hours of receipt.</p>\n<p>With respect to Crossref APIs, we plan to integrate the Crossref query features to retrieve DOIs for standards that are deposited by organizations like IEEE, ASTM, and BSI. We also plan to expand our linking and verification capabilities to incorporate newer reference types such as preprints and data citations.</p>\n<p>More broadly, we’re very excited about the eXtyles Metadata Extraction technology we released last year. This technology can be used by online submission systems and preprint servers to automatically extract key metadata elements (title, abstract, authors, affiliations, keywords) from author-submitted manuscripts, no matter what “style” the author may have used to format the manuscript. This technology is already in-use at Aries Systems to simplify the submission process. We’re looking forward, soon, to seeing this technology used by preprint servers and institutional repositories to automate the collection and deposit of preprint metadata to Crossref.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"New Board Chair Paul Peters shares our mission","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/new-board-chair-paul-peters-shares-our-mission/","published":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"At the end of last year, Paul Peters&mdash;CEO of our member Hindawi&mdash;became the new Chair of the Crossref Board.

The announcement was made in Singapore at our first LIVE Annual ever held in Asia. I caught up with Paul back in London, UK, where he answered a few questions about what he hopes to bring to the Board, and to the Crossref community as a whole.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-congratulations-paul-how-delighted-were-you-to-be-voted-in-by-your-fellow-board-members-old-and-new\">1. Congratulations, Paul. How delighted were you to be voted in by your fellow board members, old and new?</h3>\n<p>That’s a rather leading question ;-)</p>\n<p>Seriously though, I am incredibly honored to have been chosen to lead Crossref’s board at such an important point in the organization’s development. The current composition of the board is as diverse as it has ever been, which is essential if the board is to represent Crossref’s global membership, as well as the wide range of business and publication models that our members use. This diversity on the board will help to support Crossref’s aim of encouraging innovation in scholarly communication by providing open infrastructure that benefits all researchers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-youve-been-on-our-board-for-nine-years-how-has-it-changed-in-that-time-and-what-should-the-board-be-most-proud-of\">2. You’ve been on our board for nine years. How has it changed in that time and what should the board be most proud of?</h3>\n<p>When I first joined the board, Crossref was at the stage where you had successfully established persistent reference linking as a standard practice among scholarly journal publishers. And, although this was the original purpose of Crossref, it was by no means an easy task, as it required a diverse group of competing publishers to work together in building shared infrastructure for the common good.</p>\n<p>In the nine years since then, I’ve seen Crossref continue to build on this core foundation of technological expertise, the trust and goodwill of its membership, and the diverse skills of its small staff. The result has been the development of important new services (such as Similarity Check) that have become an essential component of the scholarly communications system, support new content types (including both preprints and peer review reports) that are becoming increasingly important in the move towards an Open Science future, and the expansion of Crossref’s membership to include almost 10,000 members of all shapes and sizes from 114 countries around the world.</p>\n<p>With regard to the board itself, I have been pleased to see Crossref undergo important changes that have provided greater transparency in the organization&rsquo;s governance, as well as more active participation from its members. Last year Crossref put out an open call to invite members to put themselves forward for consideration on the board. As a result of holding its first contested election, Crossref saw a dramatic increase in the engagement of members in the election process. Not only is this important for ensuring that the board is truly representative of the diverse membership, but it will also help to actively engage a larger pool of members in the important work that lies ahead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-what-do-you-see-as-crossrefs-strengths-and-role\">3. What do you see as Crossref’s strengths and role?</h3>\n<p>I believe that Crossref’s past and future success relies on two key strengths. The first is its ability to bring together a large and disparate community of organizations and individuals to create tools and services that no single organization could develop alone. People sometimes overlook how successful Crossref has been in building the trust and support of a diverse group of stakeholders, however I believe this has been an essential ingredient in the organization’s success and will be essential as Crossref develops new tools and services in the years to come.</p>\n<p>Crossref’s other core strength has been the expertise, passion, and ambitious vision of its staff, many of whom I have had the pleasure of knowing since my first days on the board. The ability to develop and maintain real-time infrastructure serving millions of end-users, while simultaneously developing new products and services, requires an incredible range of skills from technology and product development, to marketing, community outreach, and customer support. Moreover, as a growing non-profit organization with thousands of members around the world, and an international staff working across national boundaries, Crossref’s legal, financial, and administrative support team have also been an essential ingredient in the organization’s success.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-weve-grown-beyond-just-the-publisher-constituency-to-libraries-scholars-and-platforms-and-tools-which-constituencies-do-you-see-us-involving-next\">4. We’ve grown beyond just the publisher constituency to libraries, scholars, and platforms and tools, which constituencies do you see us involving next?</h3>\n<p>Over time I believe that Crossref’s constituency will grow to cover all organizations that contribute to the creation and dissemination of scholarly research, although I recognize this may take several years to achieve.</p>\n<p>In the short-term, I believe that research funders are the most important stakeholder group for Crossref to focus on, for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, with the development of the open Funder Registry and the addition of structured funding data to the Crossref registry, Crossref has already become an important provider of open infrastructure for research funders.</li>\n<li>Second, as the result of several key initiatives within the Open Science movement I believe that research funders will play an increasingly important role in determining how scholarly research outputs are created, shared, evaluated, and re-used. Therefore, the active involvement of research funders in Crossref’s membership and governance is essential.</li>\n<li>Finally, I believe that there is an important opportunity for Crossref to enable a range of new services across the research lifecycle by providing persistent identifiers and structured metadata research grants. Given how critical grants are within the research process, I’m amazed by the lack of infrastructure to monitor, evaluate, and build upon grants as first-class research objects. In many cases there is minimal, if any, public information about the grants that have been awarded by a particular funder. Even in cases where such data is available, it is rarely structured in a way that enables it to be searched or analyzed across multiple funding agencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the absence of a community-driven, non-profit organization like Crossref to provide this infrastructure on an open basis, there is a risk that funders will be forced to rely on proprietary alternatives that limit how this information is used and by whom. Fortunately there are already efforts underway within Crossref to develop both the tools and the community of funders that will be required to create persistent identifiers and structured metadata for grants and other forms of research funding.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-what-are-the-biggest-challenges-facing-crossref\">5. What are the biggest challenges facing Crossref?</h3>\n<p>I believe that Crossref’s greatest challenge will be to continue to bring together a diverse group of stakeholders, some of whom are regularly at odds with each other, in order to collaborate in developing tools and services for the benefit of the research community.</p>\n<p>As challenging as it has been for Crossref to bring together competing publishers to build the shared services that we have all come to depend on, I believe that keeping the community focused towards a common goal will become even more challenging as that community expands to include funders, universities, and the many other organizations involved in the scholarly communications ecosystem. However, I think that Ed and his team have as good of a chance of succeeding as anyone could hope for, which is why I am so excited about Crossref’s future in the years ahead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-how-will-things-change-with-you-as-chair-youll-be-busier-i-guess-but-enough-about-you-already-what-can-we-expect-as-staff-and-board\">6. How will things change with you as Chair? You’ll be busier I guess. But enough about you already, what can we expect as staff and Board?</h3>\n<p>As my first order of business I’ll be getting rid of Crossref’s corporate jet, lavish office spaces, and executive chef. <code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>On a more serious note, my hope is that as Chair I will be able to work with the other members of the board in supporting Crossref’s staff as they work to achieve the ambitious goals we have set out during the past year. I believe that Crossref’s board members and staff are aligned in the desire to significantly expand the range of services Crossref provides, as well as the communities it serves.</p>\n<p>The board still has an important role to play in shaping the organization’s strategic vision, while giving staff ample space to execute on this vision. Said another way, I hope to enable some lively strategic conversations among the board while making sure that we don’t get in the way of Ed and his team once it’s time to put ideas into action.</p>\n<p>On a more personal note, I hope to be a good sounding board for Ed on any issues that he faces, either internally or externally, on the road ahead. Given my own experience in leading a growing organization through a period of significant change, I know how important it can be to have someone to talk to when difficult challenges arise, which they inevitably will. I hope that I can be a good advisor&mdash;and also a good friend&mdash;to Ed as he leads Crossref into the exciting future that lies ahead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ginny-thanks-paul-i-know-ed-will-miss-his-personal-chef-but-we-look-forward-to-working-with-you-too\">Ginny: Thanks, Paul.

Voting members can also take metadata out of our system — and many of you do — however, your key relationship with us is as a member who is contributing to the scholarly record.</p>\n<p>It also means you have <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/membership/terms\">obligations</a> to keep your records up-to-date, and maximize links with other Crossref members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-difference-between-the-voting-categories\">What&rsquo;s the difference between the voting categories?</h2>\n<p><strong>Members</strong><br>\nAs a Member (formerly known as Publishers), you create and disseminate content, register your own content with us (usually under a single prefix), and are able to vote in our board elections. You pay an annual fee based on your publishing revenue, plus Content Registration fees for all new DOIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Sponsoring Members</strong><br>\nAs a Sponsoring Member (formerly known as a Sponsoring Publisher), you do everything a standard member does, but as well as registering your own content under your own DOI prefix, you also register content on behalf of other, smaller publishers (ideally using separate DOI prefixes so the metadata is accurate and can be reported on separately and relied upon downstream).</p>\n<p>When you vote, you vote on behalf of the organizations that you sponsor. You pay an annual fee based on your publishing revenue/expenses plus the publishing revenue of your sponsored organizations, and you also pay Content Registration fees for all new metadata records registered.

You also often look after their administrative, technical, billing and language support needs. You&rsquo;ll pay us an annual fee based on the publishing revenue of all your members, and Content Registration fees for all new DOIs. You might charge the members you work with for this service. You also provide support and promotion of our services and activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Sponsored Organizations</strong><br>\nAs a Sponsored Organization (formerly known as a Sponsored Member), you do create and disseminate content yourself, but you don&rsquo;t register your own content.

Of course, your Sponsoring Member needs to represent your needs too when voting, so make sure you make them known!</p>\n<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>\nAs a Service Provider you work closely with our members to collect and/or host and/or deposit metadata on their behalf. Unlike a Sponsoring Organization however you don&rsquo;t get involved with administrative, technical, billing or language support for the members you work with, but you&rsquo;re a key partner in helping them deposit quality metadata and contribute effectively to the scholarly record.

Robert Kiley (Open Research) and Nina Frentrop (Grants Operations) from the Wellcome explain the potential benefits this would deliver and how it might work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>As a funder we want to be able to track the outputs that arise from research we have funded. Currently, this is not as straightforward as it should be as researchers do not always cite their funder correctly, let alone their specific grant number. And, even when they do this accurately, because every funder users its own set of grant IDs, these numbers are not unique. For example, we can use EuropePMC to look up outputs from <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/grantfinder/results?gid=207467&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">grants with ID 207467</a>, and see that there is one Wellcome grant with this number, and one from the European Research Council.</p>\n<p>To resolve such issues, we need a system in which every grant awarded is giving a unique, global ID. Global IDs are already assigned to articles <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DOIs</a>, people <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ORCIDs</a> and even biological materials <a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resources\" target=\"_blank\">RRIDs</a>. It is time for the funder community to follow suit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"benefits-of-an-open--global-grant-identifier-system\">Benefits of an open &amp; global grant identifier system</h3>\n<p>Once implemented, it would make the identification of grant-specific research outputs more accurate, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on the researcher.</p>\n<p>Currently, researchers are typically asked to manually disclose what outputs have arisen from their funding. In the future, such disclosures would be fully automated. We are already seeing how publishers&mdash;who collect ORCIDs through their manuscript submission system&mdash;automatically update the author’s ORCID record with details of new publications. If a global ID system for grants was developed, publishers and repositories could also require these to be disclosed on submission, and this data could then programmatically be passed to researcher assessment platforms, like <a href=\"https://www.researchfish.net/\" target=\"_blank\">ResearchFish</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-would-it-work\">How would it work?</h3>\n<p>For a global grant ID system to work, two things need to happen. First, when a new grant is awarded, that grant must be assigned a unique ID. For the pilot project we plan to contract with Crossref who will register a unique ID, (a DOI) for every grant we register.</p>\n<p>Second, every DOI must resolve to a publicly accessible web site, where information about that grant is disclosed. Again, for this pilot we will almost certainly use the Europe PMC <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/grantfinder\" target=\"_blank\">Grants Finder Repository</a>, as we already make grant data available from this resource.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZLx7Bv9tXIKVm9oYjnuTDCxLzmdLjcgdUBfSr6h20AY/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">working group</a> has been established to determine precisely what metadata we should make available, but it is likely to include the name of the grant holder, title and value of the award, a short abstract, along with the name of the funder and the unique ID.\nMindful that funders already assign IDs to the grants they award and that any changes to this process may be problematic (and certainly time consuming), the plan is to register a DOI which still makes use of the existing grant ID. To make it unique however, the ID will be prefixed with a funder identifier, most likely the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\">Funder Registry ID</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h3>\n<p>Whilst the metadata working group is focusing on the technical aspects of the pilot, a separate “governance group” is examining how a funder might become a member of Crossref and what the business model for registering grant DOIs should be.</p>\n<p>In parallel with this, a pilot “proof of concept” initiative is under way, and we anticipate that by autumn 2018 we will have registered DOIs for a defined cohort of grants.</p>\n<p>Ultimately we want to get to a situation where every grant has a unique ID, which can then be unambiguously linked to the all outputs – articles, data, code, materials, patents etc. – which arise from it.</p>\n<p>And, if every funder were to adopt such a system and expose their grant metadata in a consistent, machine-readable way, it would facilitate the development of applications to help funders get a greatly enhanced picture of the global funding landscape, which in turn would inform strategic planning and resource allocation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thanks-to-guest-authors\">Thanks to guest authors:</h2>\n<p>Robert Kiley, Head of Open Research, Wellcome [<a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4733-2558\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID: 0000-0003-4733-2558</a>]\nNina Frentrop, Grants Information &amp; Systems Manager, Wellcome</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Please read <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/funders\">Crossref for funders</a> for context, and contact <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">Ginny Hendricks</a> at Crossref with any questions.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Meet the members, Part 2 (with protocols.io)","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/meet-the-members-part-2-with-protocols.io/","published":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Second in our Meet the members blog series is Lenny Teytelman, co-founder and CEO of protocols.io, who gives us a bit of insight into his background and why he started protocols.io, what the future plans for...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Christine Cormack Wood","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>Second in our <em>Meet the members</em> blog series is Lenny Teytelman, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io\" target=\"_blank\">protocols.io</a>, who gives us a bit of insight into his background and why he started protocols.io, what the future plans for protocols.io are, and how they use and benefit from being a Crossref member.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/large-logo.png\" alt=“protocols.io logo\" height=\"150px\" width=\"250px\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"can-you-tell-us-a-little-bit-about-yourself-and-why-you-started-protocolsio\">Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, and why you started protocols.io?</h2>\n<p>I am a computational and experimental biologist, and it was my struggle with correcting a published research method as a postdoctoral researcher at MIT that led me to co-found <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io\" target=\"_blank\">protocols.io</a>. I spent a year and a half correcting a single step of a research recipe. Instead of 1ul of a chemical, it needed 5, instead of a 15-minute incubation, it needed an hour. But this was a correction of something previously published, not a new method, so absurdly, it was not a result that I could publish. That means I got no credit for this year and a half, and more importantly, every other scientist using this recipe is either getting misleading results or has to waste 1-2 years rediscovering what I know—rediscovering something that I’d love to share, but have no easy way of doing so.</p>\n<p>So, I became obsessed with creating a central place where scientists can easily share and discover detailed research recipes. We’re open access, free-to-read and free-to-publish, with web &amp; mobile apps that make these protocols dynamic and interactive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-problem-is-your-service-trying-to-solve\">What problem is your service trying to solve?</h2>\n<p>Currently, methods sections of research papers are full of things like &ldquo;we used a slightly modified version of the method reported in paperX&rdquo;. Here are two examples:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2017: “Devices were fabricated as previously described [ref 8]” <br><br>[ref 8] 2015: “Devices were fabricated as previously described [ref 4]”<br><br>[ref 4] 2013: “Devices were fabricated as previously described [ref 2]”<br><br>[ref 2] 2009: “Devices were fabricated with conventional methods”</p>&mdash; Daniel Gonzales (@dgonzales1990) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dgonzales1990/status/953737802205794304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 17, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>We are working to increase reproducibility, by encouraging precise detailing of methods and then making it easy to keep these methods up-to-date, long after the paper is published. More broadly, our mission is to accelerate science by getting the detailed knowledge out of paper notebooks, and getting it out in months, instead of years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tell-us-a-little-bit-about-what-you-publish-and-for-whom\">Tell us a little bit about what you publish and for whom.</h2>\n<p>Both the content, and the audience for it, has been expanding recently. When we launched in 2014, the protocols were almost exclusively wetlab biology recipes. In 2015, we added support for computational workflows and began to see bioinformatics methods. More recently, thanks to the referrals from <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone\" target=\"_blank\">PLOS ONE,</a> we&rsquo;ve started to see protocols for human trials, medical devices, psychology, and more. About half a year ago, we changed our landing page form &ldquo;Open Access Repository of Life Science Methods&rdquo; to the more general &ldquo;Open Access Repository of Research Methods&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The readership is also broadening, it’s no longer just professional researchers—we now have protocols and guidelines for undergraduate and high school students, instructions for citizen science projects, and even standard operating procedures for lab management. We&rsquo;ve also been seeing more off-the-shelf use, with people sharing actual cooking recipes, and we recently began asking authors to classify whether they are sharing &ldquo;research&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-research&rdquo; instructions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-would-you-describe-the-value-of-being-a-crossref-member\">How would you describe the value of being a Crossref member?</h2>\n<p>Without a doubt, we would be nowhere close to the adoption and sharing that we have now if we were not members of Crossref, registering DOIs for all public protocols. This is an absolute prerequisite for being included in author guidelines of journals, and we wouldn&rsquo;t have grown in 2017 from two to over 200 journals that encourage authors to detail their recipes on <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io\" target=\"_blank\">protocols.io</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the benefit to <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io\" target=\"_blank\">protocols.io,</a> there is a benefit to the scientists in terms of the quality control that Crossref ensures among the members. Much of this is behind the scenes and invisible to the researchers visiting <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io\" target=\"_blank\">protocols.io</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, in the beginning, we used to simply delete spam protocols. However, once we started issuing DOIs, we realized that we would be violating the Crossref requirements for minted DOIs if we simply trashed these. As a result, we had to build &ldquo;retraction&rdquo; functionality that allows us to take down content, put up a notice explaining the reason for removal, and keep the record so that the respective DOI continues to resolve. This is the correct way to handle removals of scientific content and it is Crossref that made us mature and improve the platform. (We&rsquo;ve since had to use the retraction functionality at the request of scientists, and we&rsquo;re glad we implemented it to comply with the Crossref requirements.)</p>\n<p>Another example is the resolution report that we routinely get from Crossref, showing us which DOIs are broken. It highlights errors for us and helps us to investigate, identify, and prevent problems with the journal partners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-you-see-as-the-value-of-crossref-beyond-protocolsiohttpswwwprotocolsio\">What do you see as the value of Crossref, beyond <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io\" target=\"_blank\">protocols.io</a>?</h2>\n<p>As I argued <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta2M_gkgeKI&amp;list=PLe_-TawAqQj16f8DRwCADugYIaaXN_fZO&amp;index=9\" target=\"_blank\">in my talk</a> at the annual Crossref conference, we are finally in a position to connect scientists with the knowledge they need, automatically. Almost every scientist uses a reference manager such as Mendeley, Zotero, Paperpile, etc. to manage their literature bibliography. In turn, that means that in theory, when something happens to a paper or research objects connected to the paper (retraction, correction, update to the dataset accompanying the manuscript), the reference management platforms could notify every scientist who has that paper in their library.</p>\n<p>The problem is that it isn&rsquo;t feasible for every service like Mendeley to connect to every repository and publisher to track events connected to every paper. This is where Crossref is positioned so powerfully. By collecting the metadata linking papers to the research objects, Crossref can be the single source that the platforms need to query to see if there is news for their users related to any specific published paper. (More of this from my talk was captured really nicely in <a href=\"http://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/scholarly-maps-recommenders-reference.html\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> blog post by the SMU librarian Aaron Tay.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-future-plans-for-protocolsiohttpswwwprotocolsio\">What are the future plans for <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io\" target=\"_blank\">protocols.io</a>?</h2>\n<p>Expanding <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io\" target=\"_blank\">protocols.io</a> content to include chemistry workflows is an important goal for 2018-19.</p>\n<p>We are also eager to start on connecting the protocols directly to the devices that the scientists use. Imagine you need to spin your cells for 30 seconds, but the centrifuge is accidentally set for 3 minutes. Our app should be able to connect to the equipment and alert the researcher to the wrong setting, asking if they are sure they want to proceed.</p>\n<br>"},{"id":null,"title":"No longer lost in translation","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/no-longer-lost-in-translation/","published":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000","description":"More than 80% of the record breaking 1,939 new members we welcomed in 2017 were from non-English speaking countries, and as our member base grows in its diversity, so does the need for us to share information...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Christine Cormack Wood","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>More than 80% of the record breaking 1,939 new members we welcomed in 2017 were from non-English speaking countries, and as our member base grows in its diversity, so does the need for us to share information about Crossref and its services in languages appropriate to our changing audience.</p>\n<p>So, early last year we started translating our service videos into six other languages: French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

(I am, I realize, exposing myself here—see what I did there? —by using a word like foolproof.)</p>\n<p>First we produced the videos in English, setting the content to animation and sound (AKA audio visual or A/V to us marketing types), then we brought in a translation company to turn the English content into the six other languages. So far so good. However, as the above examples demonstrate, the <em>meaning</em> of words can get lost in translation. Also, what Crossref does isn’t the easiest thing in the world to translate (<em>are</em> there words for <em>metadata delivery</em> and <em>full-text XML</em> in Japanese?), so we added another stage to the process.</p>\n<p>Next, we sent the translated scripts and their English counterparts to some very helpful international members who, as part of the scholarly research community, understand the complexities of our work and are therefore qualified to check that the text had remained <em>in context.</em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it hadn’t, as the text came back from them heavily edited. After round two of the editing process, the revised text was applied to the videos—but just to be 100% sure, we sent the completed videos back to our helpful international members for a final run through.</p>\n<p>Multiply this painstaking process by 48 videos, throw numerous time zones into the mix and you can see why it took us nearly 12 months to complete them.</p>\n<p>And so, it is with great pleasure that today we launch all eight of our service videos in six languages, just click the links below, and enjoy!

Increasingly, our community includes new contributors like scholars, funders, and universities. Together, we are all working toward the same goal&mdash;to enhance scholarly communications.

I&rsquo;m heading to <a href=\"https://pidapalooza.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PIDapalooza</a>, the Persistent Identifier festival, as it returns for its second year. It&rsquo;s all about to kick off.</p>\n<p>One of the themes this year is &ldquo;bridging worlds&rdquo;: how to bring together different communities and the identifiers they use. Something I really enjoyed about PIDapalooza last year was the variety of people who came. We heard about some &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; identifier systems (at least, it seems that way to us): DOIs for publications, DOIs for datasets, ORCIDs for researchers. But, gathered in Reykjavik, under dark Icelandic skies, I met oceanographic surveyors assigning DOIs to drilling equipment, heard stories of identifiers in Chinese milk production and consoled librarians trying navigate the identifier landscape.</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual scholarly publishing and science communication crowd, it was encouraging to see a real diversity of people from different walks of life encounter the same problems and work on them them collaboratively. The thing that brought everyone together was the understanding that if we&rsquo;re going to reliably reference things &ndash; be they researchers, articles they write, or ships they sail &ndash; we need to give them identifiers. And those identifiers should be as good as possible: persistent, resolvable, interoperable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-cares-about-pids\">Who cares about PIDs?</h2>\n<p>At the turn of the century, a handful of publishers came together to create Crossref (or <em>CrossRef</em> as it was in those days). It was becoming increasingly important to be able to store references in machine-readable format, but publishers were faced with a problem. If an author wants to cite an article, they&rsquo;ll do so without worrying who published it. This means they needed an identifier system that worked across all publishers. Thus the Crossref DOI was born.</p>\n<p>Today we&rsquo;re heading toward 10,000 members, and the thing that they have in common is that they all produce scholarly content and care about how it&rsquo;s referenced. As a trade association, we effectively act on behalf of all of our members, allowing them to register their content, share metadata and links, and assign an identifier.</p>\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a whole world out there. Publications have never been the be-all and end-all of scholarship, but they have been a backbone. But more and more scholarship, especially science, is done outside journal publishing. Sometimes it&rsquo;s done on platforms that care about the scholarly record as much as publishers. And sometimes it isn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-twitterverse\">The Twitterverse</h2>\n<p>Lots of people use Twitter to talk about science. Some are scientists, some aren&rsquo;t. Scientific articles are linked from news reports and discussed on blogs. Gone are the days of scholarly articles being cited only by other scholarly articles. We see links coming in from all over the place. And, although not all of this can be counted as the &ldquo;scholarly record&rdquo;, some of it <em>could</em> be.</p>\n<p>The barrier-to-entry for journals publishing means that science journals contain only science articles. The barrier-to-entry for Twitter means that anyone can, and does, publish there. My Twitter feed is finely balanced between bibliometrics research, marine biology and pictures of snow leopards with Japanese captions. I don&rsquo;t understand all of it, but I like looking at the pictures.</p>\n<p>Back in the days when the only references to scholarly publications were from other scholarly publications, it was easy to keep track of those references. When an article was published, its references went into a citation database. This happened because the publisher considered this important.</p>\n<p>But Twitter, the publisher of tweets, doesn&rsquo;t care. It is used for a huge variety of communications and although some people choose to use it to engage in scholarship, we&rsquo;re just a blip on their radar. The same goes for Reddit, a platform that describes itself as &ldquo;the front page of the Internet&rdquo;. There are communities engaged in scientific discussions, but Reddit doesn&rsquo;t feel the need to publish its bibliographic references.</p>\n<p>Nor should it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bridging-those-who-care-with-those-who-dont\">Bridging those who care with those who don&rsquo;t</h2>\n<p>The barrier-to-entry for contributing to scientific discussions has lowered, meaning that the role of more non-specialist platforms has increased.</p>\n<p>I imagine that there are other communities out there who have their own concerns about the web. Maybe there are model train enthusiasts who want to keep track of every reference to a particular model. Or political commentators who want to keep track of how certain politicians and policies are discussed. As the scholarly community embraces new platforms for communicating, we should recognise that we are part of a broader universe of people using those platforms for more diverse reasons.</p>\n<p>Gone are the days when the only way to reply to an article was by writing a letter to the editor. But also gone are the days when you could guarantee that your letter wouldn&rsquo;t appear next to cat pictures (assuming you weren&rsquo;t writing to the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jfm\" target=\"_blank\">Journal of Feline Medicine &amp; Surgery</a>). As a specialist community cohabiting online spaces with non-specialists, it falls to us to do whatever we need to adapt that space and make it our own. In our case, this means recording bibliographic references as and where they occur.</p>\n<p>Something like this happened once before. As traditional publishers went online, they created Crossref to build and maintain the necessary infrastructure. We&rsquo;re acting on behalf of the community again to collect links from non-traditional sources. Because we can&rsquo;t go to platforms like Twitter and say &ldquo;please deposit your references&rdquo;, we&rsquo;re doing the opposite. We identify a platform, then work out how to scrape its content and extract links.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-at-scale\">Working at scale</h2>\n<p>So we&rsquo;re broadening out the universe of references that we would like to track from &ldquo;traditional scholarly publishing&rdquo; to &ldquo;the entire web&rdquo;. There are four broad challenges inherent in this, and we think that Crossref infrastructure is the right way to meet them.</p>\n<p>The first challenge is physically finding the links. Because social media platforms aren&rsquo;t specialised for scholarly publishing, they don&rsquo;t have the same mechanisms in place for capturing bibliographic references. This means that we have to do it ourselves by scraping webpages for references. As the standard-bearer for scholarly PIDs, we think we can do a good job of this.</p>\n<p>The second challenge is doing this at the scale of the web. Because we might, in theory, find a link on any webpage, there is a literally infinite number of publishing platforms. From big websites like BBC News down to tiny blogs run out of a bedroom. It would be impossible to partner with each of these individually. The way to solve this is to run a centralised service which goes out and contacts as many sources as possible. This role is a collaborative one. Our system is open to inspection, suggestions and contributions from the community.</p>\n<p>The third challenge is the sheer number of publishers. Because they all register content with us, we are in good position to track their DOIs. In addition to that, every member of Crossref publishes content on their own platform, and has their own set of websites to track. We monitor our members&rsquo; websites and create a central list of domains that we look for. If this wasn&rsquo;t done centrally, each publisher would have to run its own web crawlers and perform the same work, only to filter out their own links.</p>\n<p>The fourth challenge is how to get all that data to the public. Even if every publisher were able to run their own infrastructure, it would make it very difficult to consume. Through Crossref metadata services, publishers have built a system where you can look up metadata and link to articles without worrying who published them. We think that the same approach should apply to this new link data.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we&rsquo;re building Crossref Event Data: a system that monitors as many platforms as we can think of, and brings them into one place, and serves the whole community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-bridges\">Building bridges</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/authors/joe-wass/\">following along</a> you&rsquo;ll know that <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/you-do-want-to-see-how-its-made-seeing-what-goes-into-altmetrics/\">my last metaphor was the process of refining crude oil</a>. I like metaphors, and mixing them. After all, you can&rsquo;t mix a good metaphor without breaking a few eggs into the mixing bowl. Today&rsquo;s metaphors are bridges. And not just one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bridge-1-pids-and-urls\">Bridge 1: PIDs and URLs</h2>\n<p>In the world of Persistent Identifiers, we&rsquo;re quite good at linking. Organizations like Crossref, DataCite and ORCID run separate systems but we work together to record and exchange links. But the web is different. There&rsquo;s no single organization in control and there are many organizations working to catalogue it. Event Data is our offering: bridging the web with our identifiers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bridge-2-scholarly-link-providers\">Bridge 2: Scholarly link providers</h2>\n<p>Of course, some platforms and systems <em>do</em> care about persistence and Persistent Identifiers. Event Data is an open platform, and we&rsquo;re collaborating with a few providers to publish links.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve partnered with <a href=\"https://www.lens.org/lens/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lens</a> to include Patent to DOI references. We&rsquo;re working with F1000 to include links between reviews and articles. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll see more organizations use Event Data to publish their links.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bridge-3-crossref--datacite\">Bridge 3: Crossref / DataCite</h2>\n<p>Event Data is a collaborative project between DataCite and Crossref. When Crossref Registered Content contains a reference to a DataCite DOI we put it into Event Data. DataCite do the same in reverse. This means that Event Data contains a huge number of article - dataset links.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bridge-4-traditional-discussions-vs-new-ones\">Bridge 4: Traditional discussions vs new ones</h2>\n<p>At each moment, scholarly discussions are happening in the literature, on various social media platforms and on the web at large. They are all talking about the same thing, but are spread out. Event Data collects links wherever we find them and brings them into one place. By doing this we hope we can help bring those conversations together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bridge-5-bridging-bibliometricians-and-altmetricians-to-data-sources\">Bridge 5: Bridging bibliometricians and altmetricians to data sources</h2>\n<p>Capturing links from social media to published literature underpins the field of altmetrics. By collecting this data and making it available under open licenses, we bring it to altmetrics researchers. We don&rsquo;t provide metrics, but we do provide the data points that can form the basis for research.</p>\n<p>Without infrastructure for collecting data, researchers would have to perform the same work over and over again. Because the data is all open, we allow datasets to be republished, reworked and replicated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bridge-6-bridging-the-evidence-gap\">Bridge 6: Bridging the Evidence Gap</h2>\n<p>Running Event Data involves collecting a lot of data - gigabytes per day - and boiling it down into hundreds of thousands of individual Events per day. People consuming the data may want to do further boiling down. At every point of the process we record the input data that we were working from, the internal thought process of the system, and the Events that were produced. A researcher can use the Evidence Logs to trace through the entire process that led to an Event.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re a bridge from websites and social media to data consumers. But we take the role very seriously, and there&rsquo;s nothing hidden. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangjiajie_Glass_Bridge\" target=\"_blank\">glass bridge</a>, you could say.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interesting-challenges\">Interesting challenges</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not all plain sailing. There are a few challenges along the way to collecting this data which anyone who wanted to collect this kind of information would face. By collecting it in a central place and running an open platform we can solve each problem once, and improve our process as a community.</p>\n<p>One problem is choosing what to include. We include any link that we find from a non-publisher website. That means that invariably some of the links are from spam. This problem isn&rsquo;t new: we see low-quality articles being published in traditional journals from time to time. We try to include all of the data we can find and pass it onto consumers. They might want to whitelist certain sources, or they may want all of the data because they&rsquo;re trying to study scholarly spam. We have decided to provide data as Events, which strike the balance between atomicity and usefulness.</p>\n<p>Another, which I talked about at last year&rsquo;s PIDapalooza, is how we track article landing pages. Read <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/urls-and-dois-a-complicated-relationship/\">the blog post</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/data/ids-and-urls/\" target=\"_blank\">user guide</a> or hop in a time machine if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-thing-about-bridges\">The thing about bridges&hellip;</h2>\n<p>&hellip; is that they help people get where they&rsquo;re going. With a few notable exceptions, they&rsquo;re not the main attraction. We play a humble part in scholarly publishing, helping collect and distribute metadata. Most of what we do goes unseen, and helps people create tools, platforms and research. Event Data is an API, and whilst we hope people will build all kinds of things with it, including altmetrics tools, we&rsquo;re not making another metric.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pidapalooza\">PIDapalooza</h2>\n<p>All of which brings me to my talk, which I&rsquo;m giving on Wednesday: <a href=\"https://pidapalooza18.sched.com/event/Cwmw/event-data-bridging-persistent-and-not-so-persistent-identifiers\" target=\"_blank\">Bridging persistent and not-so-persistent identifiers</a>.

For those not familiar with the arcane workings...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Damian Pattinson","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>I was invited recently to present parliamentary evidence to the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee on the subject of Research Integrity. For those not familiar with the arcane workings of the British Parliamentary system, a Select Committee is essentially the place where governments, and government bodies, are held to account. So it was refreshing to be invited to a hearing that wasn’t about Brexit.</p>\n<p>The interest of the British Parliament in the integrity of scientific research confirms just how far science’s ongoing “reproducibility crisis” has reached. The fact that a large proportion of the published literature cannot be reproduced is clearly problematic, and this call to action from MPs is very welcome. And why would the government not be interested? At stake is the process of how new knowledge is created, and how reliable that purported knowledge is.</p>\n<p>The other issue driving this overview of research practices are the cases of deliberate fraud and wrongdoing that have recently created headlines (e.g., the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/stap-1.15332\" target=\"_blank\">STAP papers</a> concerning the reprogramming of stem cells). While these cases are clearly dramatic outliers, they nevertheless serve to diminish public confidence in scholarly research and the findings that come out of this enterprise.</p>\n<p>As with most inquiries, the question quickly boiled down to: who is to blame? As Bill Grant MP asked me directly, “Where does the responsibility lie?”</p>\n<p>My answer was lifted from an article by Ginny Barbour and colleagues in <em>F1000Research</em> this November (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.13060.1\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.13060.1</a>): publishers are responsible for the integrity of the published literature, while institutions and employers are ultimately responsible for the conduct of their staff. Misconduct entails intent, usually to deceive the reader into believing a conclusion that the researcher wishes them to believe. But journal editors can never know, and are not in a position to investigate, whether a researcher has <em>deliberately</em> falsified their data.</p>\n<p>However, there are things that publishers can do to ensure high standards of integrity. Much of this involves making a study’s authors publish as much information about what they have done as possible - the more the reader can see of how data were generated, the more that reader can trust the findings communicated in the published article.</p>\n<p>Article metadata directly supports this function. It provides structure and transparency to information pertaining to ethics and integrity. And because metadata is independent of the main article, it can be readable even if the article itself is locked behind a paywall.</p>\n<p>Crossref already provides metadata that can demonstrate the integrity of published articles. The metadata collected on 91+ million scholarly works across publishers and disciplines is open and freely accessible to all. Bibliographic information, for example, allows readers to see who the authors of the article are, where they are from, and what else they have published. Similarly, funding data allows readers to identify potential conflicts of interest, for example if the funder has commercial or political affiliations. Even if the reader cannot see the conflict of interest statement (or if the journal has not provided one), they can use the funding statement to surface potential conflicts.</p>\n<p>And if they wanted, publishers could provide additional metadata to add still more transparency to the research process. Ethical approval by institutional review boards, for example, could be captured, and any protocol numbers traced back to the original ethics committee approval. At present the process of ethical approval varies from country to country, and from institution to institution. Encouraging authors and journals to deposit information on the approval process would both demonstrate the high ethical standards the author is working to, and also improve the standards themselves, since institutions would have to encode their approval processes in a way that is understandable to others. This could pave the way to significantly higher international ethical standards, all through a simple addition to the indexed metadata underlying the scholarly literature.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One key recommendation that I and many others made to the Committee was, in short, &ldquo;show your work&rdquo;. As a researcher, that means showing your data. As a publisher, that means showing what checks you have done. In both cases, metadata can help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A major issue that publishers and researchers can – and should – address is the provision of actual scientific data. Most papers, today, present only the end results of the authors’ (often quite extensive) analyses. The case for sharing data is an obvious one - many recent cases of misconduct could have been identified earlier, or even avoided altogether, if editors and readers had had access to underlying datasets.</p>\n<p>With images, a requirement to submit raw images alongside the edited figures would dramatically reduce the cases of manipulation that are rife in the literature (studies suggest up to 20% of papers have some kind of inappropriate figure manipulation, with around 1 in 40 papers showing manipulation beyond that which can be expected to be a result of error). Similarly, providing the numbers that a paper’s analyses are based upon would allow readers to fully assess if datasets are distributed as would be expected through random sampling, and, if they choose, to determine if the data are sufficient to support the statistical inferences made in the paper. The Crossref schema – by providing unique identifiers to data citations - makes this link between data and paper possible. (See the recent blog post on the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-research-nexus-better-research-through-better-metadata/\">Research Nexus</a> for more information.)</p>\n<p>For publishers, showing your work also means being transparent to your readers about the editorial checks that a manuscript has undergone. Crossref has a tool that enables this editorial transparency: it’s called <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark\">Crossmark</a>. Crossmark allows readers to see the most up-to-date information about an article, even on downloaded PDFs. In most cases it is used to show whether the version of an article is most recent one, or whether any corrigenda or retractions have been subsequently added. But it can also be used to provide whatever information a publisher wishes to share about the paper. Some journals have experimented with using Crossmark to ‘thread’ publications together, for example, by linking all the outputs generated from a single clinical trial registration number (<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/linked-clinical-trials-are-here\">blog post here</a>). But publishers could go further and display metadata pertaining to the editorial checks they have performed on a paper. So Crossmark could tell readers that the paper has been checked for plagiarism, or figure manipulation, or reporting standards such as CONSORT or ARRIVE guidelines. Here at Research Square we have been addressing this with a series of <a href=\"https://www.researchsquare.com/researchers/badges\" target=\"_blank\">Badges</a> that researchers can apply to their papers to demonstrate what checks have been performed.</p>\n<p>Together, these implementations would provide value to the reader, who can see exactly what has been checked, and to the publisher, who can show how rigorous their editorial processes are. It would also serve to highlight the integrity of the authors who have passed all of these checks.</p>\n<p>Research integrity is not something that can be easily measured but, unlike wit or charm, it is something that people generally know that they have.* This means that they just need to be transparent in their output to demonstrate this to the world. Metadata provides a simple way of doing this, so researchers and publishers should make sure they provide it as openly as they can.</p>\n<p>*<em>with apologies to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Lee\" target=\"_blank\">Laurie Lee</a> for the mangled quote</em></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Dr. Livingstone, I presume…a two month expedition deep into the heart of research publishing","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/dr.-livingstone-i-presumea-two-month-expedition-deep-into-the-heart-of-research-publishing/","published":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Hello there.

In my first few months I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to attend three very different events with Crossref - Frankfurt Book Fair, our annual meeting (<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual/\">LIVE17</a>) in Singapore, and an OpenCon event in Oxford. Each one has given me the chance to talk to our members and other constituents, and I&rsquo;ve been really struck by what a diverse bunch you are:  from small volunteer-led society journals through universities to commercial behemoths; from Albania to Zambia (and 125 countries in between); covering everything from Ancient History to X-Ray Spectrometry.</p>\n<h2 id=\"expedition-equipment-to-suit-the-climate\">Expedition equipment to suit the climate</h2>\n<p>This diversity gives my team a huge responsibility.

Everyone should be able to clearly understand and take advantage of what Crossref offers both to you as an organization and to the wider scholarly community.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we&rsquo;re going to be making a few changes to the support materials we provide over the next 12 months&mdash;rewriting them so they&rsquo;re clearer for everyone, re-structuring our support center so there&rsquo;s a separate route through depending on your level of technical expertise and closer links with our main website, plus providing support in different languages and different formats.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sticking-together-in-a-harsh-environment\">Sticking together in a harsh environment</h2>\n<p>As someone who has previously worked in commercial publishing, something else that has struck me about working in a member organization is the difference between members and traditional &ldquo;customers&rdquo;.

From taking part in our various committees and working groups, to helping to organize <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/events/\">LIVE Local events</a>, to attending webinars and training, it&rsquo;s obvious that you feel a real sense of ownership over Crossref and our shared mission.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re hoping to make use of that great sense of community in 2018 by improving our member center, giving you more access to see the level of metadata you&rsquo;re sharing with the community (and that others are sharing) and providing more options for you to communicate with, and support each other. We&rsquo;re also going to be improving the education we offer for new members, to make sure that everyone is aware of the joint mission we all have to improve research communications.

Research is supported in a variety of ways&mdash;through grants, endowments, secondments, loans, use of facilities/equipment and even crowd-funding. In any of these cases, it is important to be able to link researchers and research outputs to details about the sources of support. This is true for prosaic reasons&mdash;to understand ROI, to map the competitive landscape, to ensure that mandates are fulfilled, to avoid double payment. But it is also true for epistemic reasons; understanding how research was funded can help contextualise that research, and help expose potential conflicts of interest or specific agendas.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\">Open Funder Registry</a> which provides a coarse mapping between research outputs and funders, but it is becoming clear that we need more fine-grained mapping directly to information about the kind of support that was provided.</p>\n<p>Awkwardly, none of us had any great ideas about alternative nomenclature, so we&rsquo;ve made the eminently practical decision to continue to use the term &ldquo;grant identifier&rdquo; whilst being aware that our aim is to define a system that applies more broadly to any form of funding or support of research. So <code>+1</code> for practicality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-do-we-need-an-open-global-grant-identifier\">Why do we need an open, global, grant identifier?</h3>\n<p>With the steady increase in research outputs, and the growing number of active researchers from both academia and industry, research stakeholders find they need to be able to automate workflows in order to scale their systems efficiently. Funders want to be able to track the outputs that arise from research they have funded. As a result, institutions find themselves having to regularly analyse and summarise the research their faculty produces. Faculty, in turn, face increasing accounting bureaucracy in order to meet all the reporting requirements that are cascading through the system. And finally, publishers are seeking to make the manuscript submission and evaluation process more efficient as well as to increase the discoverability and contextual richness of their publications.</p>\n<p>Most funders already have local, internal grant identifiers. But there are over 15K funders currently listed in the aforementioned Open Funder Registry. The problem is that each funder has its own identifier scheme and (sometimes) API. It is very difficult for third parties to integrate with so many different systems. Open, global, persistent and machine-actionable identifiers are key to scaling these activities.</p>\n<p>We already have a sophisticated open, global, interoperable infrastructure of persistent identifier systems for some key elements of scholarly communications. We have persistent identifiers for researchers and contributors (ORCID iDs), for data and software (DataCite DOIs), for journal articles, preprints, conference proceedings, peer reviews, monographs and standards (Crossref DOIs), and for Funders (Open Funder Registry IDs).</p>\n<p>And there are similar systems under active development for <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/organization-identifier/\">research organizations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/taking-the-con-out-of-conferences/\">conferences, projects</a> and <a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resources\" target=\"_blank\">resources</a> reported in the biomedical literature (e.g. antibodies, model organisms). At a minimum, open, persistent identifiers address the inherent difficulty in disambiguating entities based on textual strings (structured or otherwise). This precision, in turn, allows automated cross-walking of linked identifiers through APIs and metadata which enable advanced applications.</p>\n<p>For example, the use of identifiers can simplify user interfaces and save users time. Almost everybody in scholarly communications spends a frustrating portion of their lives copying information from one system to another. This process is not just tedious, it is also error-prone. But we are increasingly seeing systems make use of identifiers to eliminate the need for a lot of this manual copying. For example, researchers using an ORCID iD when they submit a manuscript can start to expect that their relevant ORCID biographical data will simply be imported into the manuscript tracking system so that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be manually copied over. And if said researcher has their manuscript accepted, they can also expect that their ORCID record will automatically be updated with the publication information and that their institution and/or their funder can be automatically notified of the impending publication so that relevant repositories and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_research_information_system\" target=\"_blank\">CRIS</a> systems can be populated automatically.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is a growing list of services that have been built on top of these standard identifiers. Profile systems (e.g. VIVO, Impact Story, Kudos) can automatically retrieve the latest information from a researcher&rsquo;s ORCID record. Bibliographic management tools (EasyBib, Zotero, Papers) allow researchers to cite content with the latest metadata. And similarity checking services can harvest and index the latest scholarly literature for inclusion in the tools they have developed for detecting plagiarism and fraud. Funder identifiers are already playing an important role in this metadata workflow. As of November 2017, there are 1.7 million Crossref publication DOIs that are explicitly linked to an Open Funder Registry ID. These linkages serve as a foundation for initiatives like SHARE, CHORUS, and the Jisc Publications Router.  But there are another 1+ million records that have funding information without an associated ID and, of course, 90+ million records that have no funding information at all.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So If we have global funder identifiers and they are already working, why do we need global grant identifiers as well? Don&rsquo;t we just need to increase uptake of funder identifiers? How will grant identifiers help?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First, global grant identifiers could greatly reduce the UX complexity of gathering funder information. This, in turn, would boost the collection of funding information from researchers and ensure that the information that they provide to publishers, institutions and other funders is accurate and complete.</p>\n<p>Second, the introduction of global grant identifiers would further increase the utility of links between research outputs and funding information. A grant identifier provides more granular information about the funding. Instead of just linking to information about the funder, a grant identifier would allow linking research outputs to particular research programs along with the information relating to those programs, such as grant durations, award amounts, etc. It would also allow analysis of relationships between multiple co-funding bodies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-doi-or-not-to-doi\">To DOI or not to DOI?</h3>\n<p>Clearly, we think DOIs are pretty good things. But we also aren&rsquo;t zealots. Sometimes DOIs are appropriate and sometimes they are not. For example, we were instrumental in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1awd6PPguRAdZsC6CKpFSSSu1dulliT8E3kHwIJ3tD5o/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">defining the structure of the ORCID identifier</a> and, in that case, we decided that DOIs were not appropriate.</p>\n<p>But in the case of a global grant identifier system, we think there are a number of reasons adopting DOIs would be useful:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is easy to &ldquo;overlay&rdquo; the global DOI system onto existing local identifier systems. An organization does not need to abandon their internal identifier scheme in order to use DOIs. They can instead incorporate their local scheme into the DOI structure via the simple mechanism of prepending their existing identifiers with an assigned DOI prefix and registering relevant metadata with a DOI registration agency like Crossref or DataCite.</li>\n<li>DOI links are &ldquo;persist-able&rdquo;. That is they can resolve to different online locations even if domain names change and/or the DNS system itself is replaced. This characteristic is important for a grant identifier because funding agencies - particularly government funding agencies - tend to undergo frequent reorganisations (e.g. splitting, merging, restructuring) and renaming. An indirectly resolvable identifier like a DOI (or ARK, Handle, etc.) is critical to ensure the long-term integrity of identifiers in these situations.</li>\n<li>There are 15K+ funders currently listed in the Open funder Registry. Each has their own grant identifier scheme and different levels of technical support for them (APIs, etc.). This makes it very difficult for 3rd parties to build tools that work &ldquo;generically&rdquo; with grant identifiers.  But once a local identifier scheme had been &ldquo;globalised&rdquo; by making it a DOI, third parties can build tools without having to worry about the differences between individual funder systems.</li>\n<li>Crossref and DataCite DOIs are deeply embedded in the tools and workflows of scholarly communications. Manuscript tracking systems, bibliographic management systems, metrics systems, CRIS systems, profile systems, etc. often have built-in mechanisms for consuming and making use of DOIs and their associated metadata.</li>\n<li>Crossref and DataCite DOIs are cross-disciplinary. They are used in the humanities, social sciences, sciences and in a host of communities that frequently interact with the scholarly literature for example- NGOs, IGOs, patent systems, and standards bodies.</li>\n<li>Crossref and DataCite provide a variety of APIs (e.g. REST, OAI-PMH) and services (e.g. search, Crossmark, Similarity Check, Scholix) built around DOIs.</li>\n<li>DOI&rsquo;s have a useful characteristic, which is that the &ldquo;prefix&rdquo; of a DOI can be used to determine who originally created the record with which the DOI is associated. In the case of grant identifiers, this means that the prefix of a DOI-based grant identifier could be used to automatically determine the correct funder responsible for the initial grant. This means that the UIs for entering funder/grant information could be both simplified and made more robust&mdash;which would likely increase the number of parties that collect and propagate id-based funder information.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But the use of DOIs as the basis for grant identifiers also introduces some potential barriers to adopting a standard funding identifier. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funders would need to be able to join a suitable DOI registration agency (e.g. Crossref, DataCite). Some funders (e.g. government agencies) may be restricted in their ability to &ldquo;join&rdquo; external organizations.</li>\n<li>Funders would need to be able to create new DOIs and register associated metadata with their chosen registration agency in a timely manner. Some funders may be unable to generate metadata or may not have the technical capacity to automatically register metadata.</li>\n<li>Funders would need to be able to provide an openly available (e.g. not behind access control) online resource to which the DOI would resolve. For example, a landing page describing the grant or a digital copy of the grant itself. Again, some funders may face technical barriers to providing an online resource to resolve to. In other cases there may be privacy or security reasons for not providing an open resource to which a DOI can resolve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still, the advisory group consensus has been that these barriers are generally surmountable. Most of the questions they had revolved around understanding what a DOI-based workflow would look like from the funder&rsquo;s perspective, and so we outlined the steps a funder would need to take in order to adopt DOI-based global identifiers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-doi-based-grant-identifiers-workflow\">The DOI-based grant identifiers workflow</h3>\n<p>A funder registering metadata and creating DOIs for grants would need to support the following workflow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When a grant is submitted, the funder would assign their own internal identifier for tracking, etc. For example <code>00-00-05-67-89</code>.</li>\n<li>If the grant is accepted, the funder would:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>generate a global public identifier for the grant based on the DOI. For example, assuming their prefix was <code>10.4440</code>, then the global public identifier might become <code>https://doi.org/10.4440/00-00-05-67-89</code>.</li>\n<li>create a &ldquo;landing page&rdquo; on their website (or wherever they make their grants available online) to which the global public identifier will resolve. The landing page would display a TBD set of metadata describing the grant, as well as a link to the grant itself.</li>\n<li>register the generated DOI and a TBD set of metadata with their registration agency (RA) (e.g. Crossref or DataCite). This metadata would include the URL of the landing page defined above.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Once metadata and DOIs are registered with an RA, the funder would have a series of ongoing obligations:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Update locations: If the location of the landing page changes (for example, because of a site restructuring, merger of split of the funding organization, etc.), the funder would need to update their metadata records to point the DOI to the new location.</li>\n<li>Update metadata: If metadata becomes out-of-date (e.g. the status of a grant changes, additional grant-related metadata is added, etc.), the funder would update the relevant records.</li>\n<li>Promote the use of the the DOI as the preferred global, public identifier for the grant. That is - the one that people should use when referring to or citing the grant (the funder can continue to use the original local identifier for their internal systems, etc.).  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, the advisory group thought that this workflow seemed tractable and agreed that the best way to ensure that would be to proceed to creating a working pilot of a global grant identifier system based on the DOI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h3>\n<p>Crossref is starting a grant identifier pilot. We will create two sub-groups of the funder advisory group.</p>\n<h4 id=\"group-for-governance-membership-and-fees\">Group for &ldquo;Governance, membership, and fees&rdquo;</h4>\n<p>This group will look at governance and financial issues raised by the introduction of grant identifiers. For example, it will look at whether Crossref&rsquo;s membership model works as is or might need to be adjusted in order to accommodate a new constituency. We know, for example, that some funders find it hard to become &ldquo;members&rdquo; of organizations. We might need to create other participation categories in order to accommodate these restrictions. Similarly the group will look design a pricing model of DOIs for grants in order to make sure that they cover the costs of modifying and sustaining the system for them, as well as to ensure that the pricing incentivises funders to participate. This sub-group will work closely with Crossref&rsquo;s membership and fees committee.</p>\n<h4 id=\"group-for-technical-and-metadata\">Group for &ldquo;Technical and metadata&rdquo;</h4>\n<p>This group will look at any technical changes that need to be made to registration process in order to accommodate the new participants. If there are, they are likely to center around specific metadata requirements for grants. As such, the group will likely spend most of its time agreeing to a practical metadata schema for capturing relevant information about the myriad of ways in which organizations <em>support</em> research. This group will also liaise with other relevant technical working groups, such as those who are looking at organizational identifiers and conference identifiers.</p>\n<p>The two sub-groups will first meet in January and, after a few meetings, will report back the advisory group with recommendations. Using these recommendations, we will develop an implementation plan which will include testing the infrastructure, testing metadata deposits, fee modelling, etc, with a small group of participants.</p>\n<p>If you are a funder, and you would like to have somebody from your origanization participate in one of these working groups, please <a href=\"mailto:ginny@crossref.org\">contact Ginny Hendricks</a>. Note that joining the above groups does not commit you to anything other than engaging in the discussion. We want to make sure we create a system that works for a range of funders, not just those who can start testing something right away.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"And our survey says...","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/and-our-survey-says.../","published":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Earlier this year we sent out a short survey inviting members to rate our performance.

Increasingly, these are viewed as key components in driving reproducibility and replicability. They provide transparency in reporting key methodological and analytical information. They are also used for sharing the artifacts which make up a processing trail for the results: data, material, analytical code, and related software on which the conclusions of the paper rely. Where expert feedback was also shared, such reviews further enrich this record. We capture these ideas and build on the notion of the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-article-nexus-linking-publications-to-associated-research-outputs/\">“article nexus” blogpost</a> with a new variation: &ldquo;the research nexus.&rdquo;</p>\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Article_Nexus_Reproducibility.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"article nexus for reproducibility\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n</div>\n<p>Some of Crossref’s publishing community are encouraging the scholarly communication practices surrounding these tools in a variety of ways: incorporating them into the publishing workflow, integrations between the tools and publishing systems, as well as linking and exposing the artifacts in the publications for readers to access. A special set of publishers have gone all the way and included these links into their Crossref metadata record. They insert them directly into the metadata deposit when they register the content (<a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214357426-Relationships-between-DOIs-and-other-objects\" target=\"_blank\">technical documentation</a>). Doing so, these connections reach further than the publisher platform and propagate to systems across the research ecosystem including places like indexers, research information management systems, sharing platforms (oh, the list goes on!).

Linking to video protocol</h3>\n<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, the truism might apply to moving pictures many times over. Fasel B, Spörri J, Schütz P, et al. proposed a set of calibration movements optimized for alpine skiing and validated the 3D joint angles of the knee, hip, and trunk during alpine skiing in a PLOS ONE paper: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181446\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181446</a>. These movements consisted of squats, trunk rotations, hip ad/abductions, and upright standing. The specific team responsible for designing them (Fasel B, Spörri J, Kröll J, and Aminian K) described the set of calibration movements performed but found videos to be a far more effective way to communicate the technical movements used in their study. They made the visuals available too: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.itrcem6\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.itrcem6</a>.

There is an argument for opaqueness when the act of full disclosure only limits your level of enjoyment: in my case, I need a complete lack of transparency to enjoy both chicken nuggets and David Lynch films. And that works for me. But metrics are not nuggets. Because in order to consume them, you really need to know how they’re made. Knowing the provenance of data, along with the context with which it was derived, provides everyone with the best chance of creating indicators which are fit for purpose. This is just one of the reasons why we built the Event Data infrastructure with transparency in mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-transparency-problem\">The transparency problem</h3>\n<p>For the scholarly community, alternative metrics to citation count (‘altmetrics’) are becoming increasingly popular as they can offer rich and expedited insight into today’s diverse and dynamic research environment. Research artifacts undergo an extended life online as they’re linked, shared, saved and discussed in forums both within and beyond the traditional academic ecosystem. Data on these interactions are initially fragmented and buried within platforms like social media, blogs and news sites. Downstream, there are several value-add services that collate and present that data as a single, aggregated count. We see individual data points like ‘paper X was tweeted 22 times’, and ‘paper X is referenced 16 times on Wikipedia’ being combined, homogenised, weighted and expressed as a single figure, a calculated number serving as a proxy for value. But altmetrics alone don&rsquo;t tell the whole story, and how they are calculated is not without idiosyncrasy or politics. As we each have our own unique voice and perspective, we need to ensure we understand the lenses through which these metrics are made in order to consume them effectively.</p>\n<p>The 2015 <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.4929.1363\" target=\"_blank\">Metric Tide report</a> highlighted transparency as one of the five dimensions of responsible metrics. Having access to the context used to create a metric — the provenance of the original data as well as full transparency around its extraction, processing and aggregation — helps consumers to use the data meaningfully and allows for comparison across third-party vendors. But transparency is difficult to achieve when, as the report notes, the systems and infrastructure for collecting and curating altmetrics-style data are fragmented and have limited interoperability.</p>\n<p>In the academic community, underlying centralised systems include ORCIDs to identify people and DOIs to identify items. But we’re missing a transparent, centralised infrastructure for describing and recording the relationships between objects and resources<sup>1</sup>. These relationships, or links, occur outside publisher platforms and can provide valuable information about the interconnectivity and dissemination of research. Dedicated infrastructure for collecting these relationships would provide a data source for those interested in altmetrics to build upon.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Fig1.1_EventDiagram.png\" alt=\"Event diagram\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p><em>Figure 1.1 Example of some relationships between articles and activity on the web</em></p>\n<p>At Crossref, we call these relationships Events. An Event is the record of a claim made about the existence of a relationship between a registered content item (i.e. a DOI) and a specific activity on the web. Events include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a DataCite dataset DOI contains a link to a Crossref article DOI</li>\n<li>an article was referenced in Wikipedia</li>\n<li>an article was mentioned on Twitter</li>\n<li>an article has a Hypothes.is annotation</li>\n<li>a blog contains a link to an article</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite</a>, we are collecting Events for the DOIs registered with our organisations and are making that data available for others in the community to use. This is the Event Data infrastructure, with which we’re plugging the gap in open scholarly relationships infrastructure.\n<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-transparent-record-of-life-after-publication/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-transparent-record-of-life-after-publication/</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-event-data-infrastructure\">The Event Data infrastructure</h3>\n<p>Crossref and DataCite have for many years provided a centralised location for bibliographic metadata and links, and a facility to help our members register Persistent Identifiers (DOIs) for their content. With nearly 100 million DOIs registered with Crossref, we know where research lives. Which got us thinking — could we use these links to find out more about the journey research undertakes after publication? Could we express these interactions as links without any aggregation or counts so it could be maximally reused? And if so, could we then provide this data in an open, centralised, structured format? The answer was yes, subject to some challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Querying for individual DOIs wasn’t scalable for our full corpus of 100 million items, so we had to find something else.</li>\n<li>Not everyone uses the DOI link (not a surprise!). Most people will link directly to the publisher’s site. This means we need to look for links using both the DOI and article landing page URLs.</li>\n<li>When we find people referring to registered content using its landing page, we find the DOI for that content item so that the link can be referenced in our data set in a stable, link-rot-proof way.</li>\n<li>We don’t always know the article landing page URL for every DOI upfront because like many relationships, the one <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/urls-and-dois-a-complicated-relationship/\">between DOIs and URLs</a> is complicated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We began by asking the wrong questions and as a result we got the wrong type of data back: instead of returning a record of individual actions, we were returning aggregated counts. Aside from not meeting our use case, aggregation requires the curation of an ever-churning dataset in order to keep totals updated, which is not scalable for the number of DOIs in our corpus.</p>\n<p>We soon learnt to ask the right questions. One pivotal change in approach was that instead of counts, we asked instead ‘what activity is happening on Twitter for this article?’. Our data went from ‘DOI X was mentioned 20 times on Twitter as of this date’ to ‘tweet X mentions DOI X on this date’. The data are now represented as a subject-verb-object triple:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Fig1.2_TripleTable.png\" alt=\"image table of data presented as triples\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p><em>Figure 1.2 Triple table.</em></p>\n<p>Ultimately this has allowed us to represent actions like Wikipedia page edits as individual atomic actions (i.e an Event) rather than as a dataset that changes over time.\nBeing open about the provenance of altmetrics with Event Data\nCrossref Event Data (the Crossref-specific service powered by the shared Event Data infrastructure) has evolved beyond a link store to become a continual stream of Events; each Event tells a new part of the story. Rather than constantly updating an Event whenever a new action takes place, we add a new one instead:</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Fig1.3_WikipediaEvent.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia Event example\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p><em>Figure 1.3 A Wikipedia Event.</em></p>\n<p>Events answer a whole range of questions, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What links to what?</li>\n<li>How was the link made?</li>\n<li>Which Agent collected the Event?</li>\n<li>Which data source?</li>\n<li>When was the link observed?</li>\n<li>When do we think the link actually happened?</li>\n<li>What algorithms were used to collect it?</li>\n<li>Where’s the evidence?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’re collecting data from a diverse range of platforms including Twitter, Wikipedia, blogs and news sites, Reddit, StackExchange, Wordpress.com and Hypothes.is. This means that when we observe a link in these platforms to what we think is a DOI, we create an <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/data/events/\" target=\"_blank\">Event</a> and a corresponding <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/data/evidence-records/\" target=\"_blank\">Evidence Record</a> to represent our observation. We also have Events to represent the links between research items registered with Crossref and DataCite - for example, when a Crossref DOI cites a DataCite DOI and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The provenance of the data is fully transparent and is made available to everyone via an open API. We call this the evidence trail. The record of each link (‘Events’) as well as the corresponding evidence can then be used to feed into tools for impact measurement, discoverability, collaboration and network analysis.</p>\n<p>Therefore, one application of Event Data is as an underlying, transparent data source for altmetrics calculations. For example, you might want to know the total number of times your paper has been mentioned on Twitter to date. If I told you that the number was 22, what does that actually mean? Do you know whether I counted both tweets and retweets? Do you consider both of these actions as equal? Is the sentiment of the tweet important to you? Was it a human or a bot that initiated a tweet? Are you interested in tweets containing links to multiple representations of your paper or do you only want to track mentions of your version of record (the final published copy)? With Event Data as your underlying data source, you can answer these questions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-only-transparent-in-data-transparent-by-design\">Not only transparent in data, transparent by design</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.niso.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Information Standards Organisation</a> (NISO), a US organisation responsible for technical standards for publishing, bibliographic and library applications, has developed a set of recommendations for transparency in their <a href=\"https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/17091/NISO%20RP-25-2016%20Outputs%20of%20the%20NISO%20Alternative%20Assessment%20Project.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Alternative Assessment Metrics Project report</a>, as well as a Code of Conduct for both altmetric practitioners and aggregators that aims to help improve the quality of altmetrics data. The working groups recognised that without transparency and conforming to a recognised standard, altmetric indicators &ldquo;are difficult to assess, and thus may be seen as less reliable for purposes of measuring influence or evaluation&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>Crossref Event Data is one of the example altmetric data providers listed in the NISO recommendations. My colleague Joe Wass participated in the development and specification of the NISO <a href=\"http://www.niso.org/press-releases/2016/05/niso-releases-draft-altmetrics-recommended-practices-data-metrics\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Altmetrics Recommended Practices on Data Metrics, Alternative Outputs, and Persistent Identifiers&rdquo;</a> at the same time as we were working with DataCite on Event Data, so they have mutually informed one another.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Fig1.4_photo_MartinFenner_JoeWass.JPG\" alt=\"image Martin Fenner and Joe Wass drawing plans on a whiteboard\" width=\"600px\" height=\"250\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p><em>Figure 1.4 Martin Fenner (DataCite) and Joe Wass (Crossref) drawing plans for the Event Data infrastructure.</em></p>\n<p>The outcome of our involvement in the NISO recommendations is that Crossref Event Data is a service that is transparent by design. We have opened up our entire extraction and processing workflow so that we can clearly demonstrate the context and environment that was used to generate an Event. This evidence is a core component of our transparency-first principle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"building-services-on-event-data\">Building services on Event Data</h3>\n<p>There are some really exciting ways that people are already using Event Data, and we’re still only in beta. Our aim has always been to create an open, portable, transparent data set that can be used by our diverse community including researchers, application developers, publishers, funders and third-party service providers. We have already seen data from our service used in recent research studies, impact reports and even a front-end tool. Launched recently as a prototype, ImpactStory’s <a href=\"http://paperbuzz.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Paperbuzz.org</a> uses Event Data as one of its data sources for tracking the online buzz around scholarly articles. Jason Priem, cofounder of <a href=\"https://impactstory.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ImpactStory</a>, notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Because Crossref Event Data is completely open data, we believe it&rsquo;s a game-changer for altmetrics. Our latest project, Paperbuzz.org, is just the first of a whole constellation of upcoming tools that will add value on top of Crossref&rsquo;s open data.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are working towards launching Crossref Event Data as a production service. In the meantime though, please do take a look at our comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a>. Hopefully you’ll be inspired to go make something cool using the data! Events are being collected constantly; take a look below as they stream in from our data sources or visit our <a href=\"http://live.eventdata.crossref.org/live.html\" target=\"_blank\">live stream demo</a> site to watch in real time.</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CI93UgbFPuk\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><em>Figure 1.5 Screen capture of Crossref Event Data live stream demo.</em></p>\n<p>As the service matures, we’ll continue to add new platforms to track and I also encourage anyone with article link data to get in touch to discuss how we can share it with the community via Event Data.</p>\n<p>For researchers in particular, I’m really keen to hear your thoughts on our data model and about the things we could additionally provide you with from an infrastructure perspective that would best support your research needs.</p>\n<p>And if you’re a publisher, take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/publishers-help-us-capture-events-for-your-content/\">Event Data best practice guidelines</a> — there’s some really important information in there about how you can help give us the best chance possible of collecting Events for your registered content.</p>\n<p>And finally, if you’re a consumer of altmetrics data, I encourage you to ask questions. Ask your altmetrics vendors about how they gather their data and what context they apply to the aggregation of the metrics they supply. Ask yourself what behaviours you are interested in tracking and equally those you are not. Think about the endgame; about the type of impact you’re truly trying to measure and the story you want to tell. Because it’s these questions that will help you choose indicators that are the best fit for your own unique narrative.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This content is cross-posted on <a href=\" https://elifesciences.org/labs/995b64e4/a-transparent-record-of-life-after-publication\" target=\"_blank\">eLife Labs</a>.</p>\n<p><em>References</em></p>\n<p><sup>1</sup> Bilder, Geoffrey; Lin, Jennifer; Neylon, Cameron (2015): What exactly is infrastructure?

We save lives and help rebuild livelihoods when crisis strikes. And we campaign so that the voices of the poor influence the local and global decisions that affect them.</p>\n<p>Oxfam’s Policy &amp; Practice platform is the gateway to Oxfam’s knowledge, experience, and thinking. Policy &amp; Practice aims to influence, enable and learn from others by sharing and collaborating online with professionals and practitioners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-your-role-within-oxfam\">What’s your role within Oxfam?</h2>\n<p>My name is Liam Finnis and I am the Website Manager for Oxfam GB’s <a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Policy &amp; Practice</a> site and the <a href=\"http://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/oxfam/\" target=\"_blank\">Oxfam Digital Repository</a>. In addition to maintenance and development of our platforms, my role focuses on raising the visibility of our programme work including approach and methodology, while also ensuring the availability and accessibility of our publications and resources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-your-participation-level\">What’s your participation level?</h2>\n<p>We joined Crossref in 2016, but only really began fully implementing DOIs this year. We have registered 139 content items as of October, with the majority assigned in 2017. While this only constitutes a small number of our total publications (roughly 6%), we’ve focused on current and future publications rather than retroactive application (with a handful of exceptions).</p>\n<h2 id=\"tell-us-a-bit-about-what-you-publish-and-for-whom\">Tell us a bit about what you publish and for whom</h2>\n<p>We produce roughly 220 publications each year, with a library of 4,450 spanning 40 years. Roughly half of this would be considered grey literature and includes: research reports; evaluations; briefing papers; technical briefings; case studies; guidelines and toolkits. We also publish the <em>Gender &amp; Development</em> <em>Journal</em> with Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis.</p>\n<p>While our organisational focus is on inequalities and the eradication of poverty, this isn’t something we can achieve by looking solely at economic models. Our publications span a range of subject areas including: climate change; food and livelihoods; economics; gender; conflicts and disasters; land rights; and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH).</p>\n<p>Our audience ranges from humanitarian and development practitioners to policy makers to researchers and academics. We publish the research that underpins our campaigns advocacy work; the evaluations of our emergency response efforts; reports outlining the methodologies we’ve applied; briefings on policy and recommendations; and, toolkits and guidelines for research, programme quality and responsible data management.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-you-think-makes-your-publications-unique\">What do you think makes your publications unique?</h2>\n<p>Oxfam is one of the only NGOs that is actively sharing an extensive body of knowledge and experience. With 75 years of experience working on a global scale, our publications help to share learning and encourage best practice. Further to that, they showcase the changes (gradual or sudden) that we’ve seen in how development and humanitarian aid is defined and approached through the decades.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/oxfam/handle/10546/141359\" target=\"_blank\">The Oxfam Gender Training Manual</a></em>, published in 1991, remains one of our most frequently accessed resources; still widely regarded as a relevant, unique and valuable resource within the sector. Another of our key publications, <em><a href=\"https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/oxfam/handle/10546/338125\" target=\"_blank\">Wealth: Having it all and wanting more</a></em>, was published in 2015, outlining the methodology and data sources for Oxfam’s frequently cited fact ‘85 billionaires have the same wealth as the bottom half of the world’s population’.</p>\n<p>The diversity in subject and format of our publications isn’t necessarily unique, but I’m reasonably confident that there is something in our publications that will relate to everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-trends-are-you-seeing-in-your-part-of-the-scholarly-publishing-community\">What trends are you seeing in your part of the scholarly publishing community?</h2>\n<p>This is difficult to quantify as, while we have been lightly engaged with the scholarly publishing community in the past, we’ve been significantly more active in the past year. In addition to more actively applying DOIs, early in 2017 we were included in EBSCO Discovery and in March we made efforts to improve the visibility of our Digital Repository. Previously, the key route was through the Policy &amp; Practice website, which brought together publications with blogs and pages focused on programmes, projects, approaches and methodology.</p>\n<p>Since making these two changes we’ve seen a significant increase in access of our resources directly from the repository. This has come in addition to the general usage through Policy &amp; Practice. We are also working with Research4Life, INASP and TEEAL to improve visibility and accessibility of our publications more widely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-would-you-describe-the-value-of-being-a-crossref-member\">How would you describe the value of being a Crossref member?</h2>\n<p>In the past two years, we’ve been looking into how we can ensure that our publications are visible and accessible to a wider audience. Becoming a member of Crossref and registering content with Crossref is a big part of that. It helps to give us a place in the discussions and events as well as enabling us to better understand and meeting scholarly publishing standards and implement best practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-oxfams-plans-for-the-future\">What are Oxfam&rsquo;s plans for the future?</h2>\n<p>In terms of our work with Crossref and an active role in the scholarly publishing community, we’re still fairly new to it and we’re starting to see some of the benefits of our efforts. In the future, we’re looking to get a better idea of the opportunities available and build on our recent work.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’m really interested in exploring Crossref Event Data in greater detail and seeing how it can help us map the impact of our work more effectively.</p>\n<br>\nThanks, Liam!"},{"id":null,"title":"Peer reviews are open for registering at Crossref","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/peer-reviews-are-open-for-registering-at-crossref/","published":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000","description":"About 13-20 billion researcher-hours were spent in 2015 doing peer reviews.

But these have been shoehorned into other content: article, dataset, or component. So we are extending Crossref’s infrastructure to properly treat this special scholarly artifact. This includes a range of outputs made publicly available from the peer review history (referee reports, decision letters, author responses, community comments) across any and all review rounds. We welcome scholarly discussions of journal articles before or after publication (e.g. “post-publication reviews”).</p>\n<p>We collect metadata that characterizes the peer review asset (for example: recommendation, type, license, contributor info, competing interests). We also collect metadata, which offers a view into the review process (e.g. pre/post-publication, revision round, review date).</p>\n<p>This special set will support the discovery and investigation of peer reviews as it is linked up to the article discussed. It will also enable the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable tracking of the evolution of scholarly claims through the lineage of expert discussion</li>\n<li>Support enrichment of scholarly discussion</li>\n<li>Enable reviewer accountability</li>\n<li>Credit reviewers and editors for their scholarly contribution</li>\n<li>Support publisher transparency</li>\n<li>Connect reviews to the full history of the published results</li>\n<li>Provide data for analysis and research on peer review</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please come check out our <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/115005255706\" target=\"_blank\">documentation on the new Crossref content type</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>As publishers are implementing this, we are finishing up the delivery of this metadata for machine and human access, across all the Crossref interfaces (<a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a>, <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213679866-OAI-PMH-subscriber-only-\" target=\"_blank\">OAI-PMH</a>, <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref Metadata Search</a>) to enable discoverability across the research ecosystem.

The project is modelled from the German Bielefeld University Open APC initiative, which is a part of the <a href=\"https://www.intact-project.org/openapc/\" target=\"_blank\">INTACT</a> project. After APC data has been delivered to the APC system, scripts are run against the Crossref API to fetch information about publishers and journals. <a href=\"https://github.com/Kungbib/openapc-se/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\">A description of Open APC Sweden can be found here.</a></p>\n<p>When building our local analysis database for publisher statistics, we download data from the SwePub database, use the Crossref DOIs for API lookup against Crossref to add correct ISSN and publisher data to the records and then match the records against a list of publisher serials. In this way, we can get information about how much Swedish researchers have been publishing with a certain publisher and use this data when negotiating conditions for open access publishing with the publisher in question.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-metadata-values-do-you-pull-from-the-api\">What metadata values do you pull from the API?</h3>\n<p>In Open APC Sweden, a Python script supplied by staff at the Bielefeld University is used to pull metadata about publisher and journal names and ISSN&rsquo;s from the Crossref API. The result is entered into an enriched version of the APC data files delivered by the universities and then statistics can be calculated on the result using an R script. <a href=\"https://github.com/Kungbib/openapc-se/blob/master/statistics.md\" target=\"_blank\">The result can be seen here</a>.</p>\n<p>In the local analysis database, a modified copy of the Bielefeld Python script is used to add the same metadata to the records before matching them against publisher serial ISSNs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"have-you-built-your-own-interface-to-extract-this-data\">Have you built your own interface to extract this data?</h3>\n<p>In Open APC Sweden, the Python script is developed and maintained at the Bielefeld University and an exact copy is being run in the Swedish project.</p>\n<p>In the local analysis system, the Python script is somewhat modified to suit the special demands of this system.</p>\n<p>But sometimes it is very convenient just to use the main <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DOI lookup</a> to do a manual check-up of problematic records.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-often-do-you-extractquery-data\">How often do you extract/query data?</h3>\n<p>In Open APC Sweden, usually about two-three times a month, when new datasets are delivered from the universities. In the local analysis database, usually lookups are being done on a daily basis as development of the database continues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-do-you-do-with-the-metadata-once-its-pulled-from-the-api\">What do you do with the metadata once it’s pulled from the API?</h3>\n<p>In Open APC Sweden, the metadata is going into the APC data files for processing of statistics. In the local analysis database, the metadata is used to match against publisher journal ISSN&rsquo;s.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-plans-do-you-have-for-the-future\">What plans do you have for the future?</h3>\n<p>For the Open APC Sweden I would like to build a database system to make the system more scalable than just working with flat data files.</p>\n<p>With both the SwePub system and the local analysis system, we are now using the new service oaDOI and their API to look up metadata about the open access status of the publications to enrich our local systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-else-would-you-like-to-see-the-rest-api-offer\">What else would you like to see the REST API offer?</h3>\n<p>In the process of normalising the publishers&rsquo; names, the names returned are sometimes at a &ldquo;too high&rdquo; or on a too generic level to be used to generate good statistics. For instance, Springer Nature are sometimes returned as <em>Springer Nature</em>, sometimes as <em>Springer Science + Business Media</em> and sometimes as <em>Nature Publishing Group</em>. A similar thing is valid for <em>Taylor &amp; Francis</em>, where the mother company <em>Informa UK Limited</em> is returned instead of the publishing subsidiary of the company. One thing to wish for here is that we could agree on some kind of normalisation of the publishers&rsquo; names and that Crossref could return this as a supplement to the present metadata.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks Ulf!

But despite our intent to encourage, I feel the ghost of finger-waggers past. So in the spirit of championing enthusiasm over ennui, I thought I’d attempt to contextualise our <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/best-practice/publishers-best-practice/\" target=\"_blank\">Event Data Best Practices Guide for Publishers</a> and show you why there’s a lot of good reasons for publishers to be enthusiastic about these rules.</p>\n<p>So if you’re a publisher, I encourage you to read on to learn more about how you can help us have the best chance possible of capturing Events for your content.</p>\n<div class=\"shortcode-divwrap blue-highlight\">\n<span>What&rsquo;s in it for you? Well, collecting this data helps to give everyone (Crossref, yourself, and others) a better picture of how your content is being used, including for altmetrics.</span>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"1-please-let-us-in\">1. Please let us in</h3>\n<p>Please do open the door when we come knocking, we promise not to stay long. You can do this by allowing the User Agent <code>CrossrefEventDataBot</code> to visit your site, and whitelisting it if necessary. The bot is how we visit URLs to confirm if they are for an item of content registered with us. The reason why we’re visiting your site could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>someone tweeted an article landing page</li>\n<li>someone discussed it on Reddit</li>\n<li>it was linked to from a blog post</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Bot has only one job: to work out the DOI. No information beyond this is stored. Whenever we become aware of a link that we think points to a DOI or an Article Landing Page, we follow it so we can collect the required metadata. Everything in Crossref Event Data is linked via its DOI, so it&rsquo;s important that we can collect this information.</p>\n<p>The bot will identify itself using the standard method. It sets two headers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Referer: <a href=\"https://eventdata.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://eventdata.crossref.org</a></li>\n<li>User-Agent: CrossrefEventDataBot (<a href=\"mailto:eventdata@crossref.org\">eventdata@crossref.org</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once we confirm that a link points to registered content, we then log an Event for the DOI. You should expect our bot to visit no more than once or twice per second, although if there is a period of activity around your articles, you may see higher rates. The bot also takes a sample of DOIs and visits them to work out which domain names belong to our members, so it can maintain a list. This can happen every few weeks. You may see a small number of requests from the bot, but limited to one per second.</p>\n<p>If we can’t enter your site to look for metadata though, then we won’t be able to collect Events for your DOIs. So by allowing our bot, you will be helping us to collect Event Data for your registered content.</p>\n<p>If you’re worried about traffic on your site, consider sending us your mapping of article landing pages to DOIs. Because <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/urls-and-dois-a-complicated-relationship/\">Resource URLs aren&rsquo;t the same as article landing pages</a>, we need more information than the DOI Resource URLs that you already send us.</p>\n<p>If you’re running a blog or website (and you’re not a member of Crossref), you may also see our bot visiting, to look for links that comprise Events. Please allow us to visit, so we can record in our Event Data service the fact that your website links to registered content.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-we--robotstxt\">2. We ❤️ robots.txt</h3>\n<p>Robots.txt files are important and we ensure our Event Data Bot respects yours. If we are instructed not to visit a site, we won&rsquo;t. So if you want us to visit your site in order to check the metadata of your article landing page, please ensure you provide an exception for our Bot, or make sure that you’re not blocking it. Check the restrictions in your file to see if we’re allowed to visit. This is just another way you can help us work for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-include-the-dc-identifier\">3. Include the DC Identifier</h3>\n<p>Including good metadata is general best practice for scholarly publishing. When we visit a publisher’s site, we look for metadata embedded in the HTML document (such as DC.Identifier tags that, amongst other things, enable Crossmark to work).</p>\n<p>By ensuring you include a Dublin Core identifier meta tag in each of your articles pages, our system can match your landing pages back to DOIs.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/ced-blog-code.png\" alt=\"example of code\" width=\"550px\"\nclass=\"img-responsive\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"4-let-us-in-even-if-we-dont-bring-cookies\">4. Let us in, even if we don’t bring cookies</h3>\n<p>We’re like that friend who turns up for dinner without bringing a bottle of wine. And we hope that you’ll be ok with that. Some Publisher sites don&rsquo;t allow browsers to visit unless cookies are enabled and they block visitors that don&rsquo;t accept them. If your site does this, we will be unable to collect Events for your DOIs. Allowing your site to be accessed without cookies will help give us the best chance of successfully reading your metadata.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-we-may-not-speak-your-language\">5. We may not speak your language</h3>\n<p>Sometimes we come across a publisher’s site that won’t render unless JavaScript is enabled. This means that the site won’t show any content to browsers that don&rsquo;t execute JavaScript. The Event Data Bot does not execute JavaScript when looking for a DOI. This means that if your site requires JavaScript, then we will be unable to collect DOIs for your Events. Consider allowing your site to be accessed without JavaScript. And if this is not possible, then if you ensure you include the <meta name=\"dc.identifier\"> tag in the HTML header, then we’ll do our best to collect Events for your registered content.</p>\n<p>If you want to pass this on to your friendly system administrator, the best practice is documented in full here: <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/best-practice/publishers-best-practice/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/best-practice/publishers-best-practice/</a>.

This shows the Events passing through Crossref Event Data, live, as they happen. You may need to wait a few seconds before you see anything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crossref-and-scholarly-links\">Crossref and scholarly links</h2>\n<p>You may know about Crossref. If you don&rsquo;t, we are a non-profit organisation that works with Publishers (getting on for nine thousand) to register scholarly publications, issue Persistent Identifiers (DOIs) and maintain the infrastructure required to keep them working. If you don&rsquo;t know what a DOI is, it&rsquo;s a link that looks like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678</a></p>\n<p>When you click on that, you&rsquo;ll be taken to the landing page for that article. If the landing page moves, the DOI can be updated so you&rsquo;re taken to the right place. This is why Crossref was created in the first place: to register Persistent Identifiers to combat link rot and to allow Publishers to work together and cite each other&rsquo;s content. A DOI is a single, canonical identifier that can be used to refer to scholarly content.</p>\n<p>Not only that, we combine that with metadata and links. Links to authors via ORCIDs, references and citations via DOIs, funding bodies and grant numbers, clinical trials&hellip; the list goes on. All of this data is provided by our members and most of it is made available via our free API.</p>\n<p>Because we are the central place that publishers register their content, and we&rsquo;ve got approaching 100 million items of Registered Content, we thought that we could also curate and collect altmetrics type data for our corpus of publications. After all, a reference from a Tweet to an article is a link, just like a citation between two articles is a link.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-experiment\">An Experiment</h2>\n<p>So, a few years back we thought we would try and track altmetrics for DOIs. This was done as a Crossref Labs experiment. We grabbed a copy of PLOS ALM (since renamed Lagotto), loaded a sample of DOIs into it and watched as it struggled to keep up.</p>\n<p>It was a good experiment, as it showed that we weren&rsquo;t asking exactly the right questions. There were a few things that didn&rsquo;t quite fit. Firstly, it required every DOI to be loaded into it up-front, and, in some cases, for the article landing page for every DOI to be known. This doesn&rsquo;t scale to tens of millions. Secondly, it had to scan over every DOI on a regular schedule and make an API query for each one. That doesn&rsquo;t scale either. Thirdly, the kind of data it was requesting was usually in the form of a count. It asked the question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;How many tweets are there for this article as of today?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This fulfilled the original use case for PLOS ALM at PLOS. But when running it at Crossref, on behalf of every publisher out there, the results raised more questions than they answered. Which was good, because it was a Labs Experiment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"asking-the-right-question\">Asking the right question</h2>\n<p>The whole journey to Crossref Event Data has been a process of working out how to ask the right question. There are a number of ways in which &ldquo;How many tweets are there for this article as of today?&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the right question. It doesn&rsquo;t answer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweeted by who? What about bots?</li>\n<li>Tweeted how? Original Tweets? Retweets?</li>\n<li>What was tweeted? The DOI? The article landing page? Was there extra text?</li>\n<li>When did the tweet occur?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We took one step closer toward the right question. Instead of asking &ldquo;how many tweets for this article are there as of today&rdquo; we asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;What activity is happening on Twitter concerning this article?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we record each activity we can include information that answers all of the above questions. So instead of collecting data like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Registered Content</th>\n<th>Source</th>\n<th>Count</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>10.5555/12345678</td>\n<td>twitter</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>2017-01-01</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.5555/87654321</td>\n<td>twitter</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2017-01-15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10.5555/12345678</td>\n<td>twitter</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>2017-02-01</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We&rsquo;re collecting data like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Subject</th>\n<th>Relation</th>\n<th>Object</th>\n<th>Source</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>twitter.com/tweet/1234</td>\n<td>references</td>\n<td>10.5555/12345678</td>\n<td>twitter</td>\n<td>2017-01-01</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>twitter.com/tweet/5678</td>\n<td>references</td>\n<td>10.5555/987654321</td>\n<td>twitter</td>\n<td>2017-01-11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>twitter.com/tweet/9123</td>\n<td>references</td>\n<td>10.5555/12345678</td>\n<td>twitter</td>\n<td>2017-02-06</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now we&rsquo;re collecting individual links between tweets and DOIs, we&rsquo;re closer to all the other kinds of links that we store. It&rsquo;s like the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; links that we already curate except:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&rsquo;s not provided by publishers, we have to go and collect it ourselves.</li>\n<li>It comes from a very diverse range of places, e.g. Twitter, Wikipedia, Blogs, Reddit, random web pages</li>\n<li>The places that the Events do come from don&rsquo;t play by the normal rules. <strong>Web pages work differently to articles.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"non-traditional-publishing-is-untraditional\">Non-traditional Publishing is Untraditional</h2>\n<p>This last point caused us to scratch our heads for a bit. We used to collect links within the &rsquo;traditional&rsquo; scholarly literature. Generally, journal articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get published once</li>\n<li>have a publisher looking after them, who can produce structured metadata</li>\n<li>are subject to a formal process of retractions or updates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now we&rsquo;re collecting links between things that aren&rsquo;t seen as &rsquo;traditional&rsquo; scholarship and don&rsquo;t play by the rules.</p>\n<p>The first thing we found is that blog authors don&rsquo;t reference the literature using DOIs. Instead they use article landing pages. This meant that we had to put in the work to collect links to article landing pages and turn them back into DOIs so that they can be referenced in a stable, link-rot-proof way.</p>\n<p>When we looked at Wikipedia we noticed that, as pages are edited, references are added and removed all the time. If our data set reflected this, it would have to evolve over time, with items popping into existence and then vanishing again. This isn&rsquo;t good.</p>\n<p>Our position in the scholarly community is to provide data and infrastructure that others can use to create services, enrich and build things. Curating an ever changing data set, where things can disappear, is not a great idea and is hard to work with.</p>\n<p>We realised that a plain old link store (also known as an assertion store, triple store, etc.) wasn&rsquo;t the right approach as it didn&rsquo;t capture the nuance in the data with sufficient transparency. At least, it didn&rsquo;t tell the whole picture.</p>\n<p>We settled on a new architecture, and Crossref Event Data as we now know it was born. Instead of a dataset that changes over time, we have a continual stream of Events, where each Event tells a new part of the story. An Event is true at the time it is published, but if we find new information we don&rsquo;t edit Events, we add new ones.</p>\n<p>An Event is the way that we tell you that we observed a link. It includes the link, in &ldquo;subject - relation type - object&rdquo; format, but so much more. We realised that one question won&rsquo;t do, so Events now answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What links to what?</li>\n<li>How was the link made? Was it with a article&rsquo;s DOI or straight to an Article landing page?</li>\n<li>Which Agent collected it?</li>\n<li>Which data source were they looking at?</li>\n<li>When was the link observed?</li>\n<li>When do we think the link actually happened?</li>\n<li>What algorithms were used to collect it?</li>\n<li>How do you know?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to the &ldquo;how do you know&rdquo; a bit later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-an-altmetrics-event\">What is an altmetrics Event?</h2>\n<p>So, an Event is a package that contains a link plus lots of extra information required to interpret and make sense of it. But how do we choose what comprises an Event?</p>\n<p>An Event is created every time we notice an interaction between something we can observe out on the web and a piece of registered content. This simple description gives rise to some interesting quirks.</p>\n<p>It means that every time we see a tweet that mentions an article, for example, we create an Event. If a tweet mentions two articles, there are two events. That means that &ldquo;the number of Twitter events&rdquo; is not the same as &ldquo;the number of tweets&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>It means that every time we see a link to a piece of registered content in a webpage, we create an Event. The Event Data system currently tries to visit each webpage once, but we reserve the right to visit a webpage more than once. This means that the number of Events for a particular webpage doesn&rsquo;t mean there are that many references.</p>\n<p>We might go back and check a webpage in future to see if it still has the same links. If it does, we might generate a new set of Events to indicate that.</p>\n<p>Because of the evolving nature of Wikipedia, we attempt to visit every page revision and document the links we find. This means that if an article has a very active edit history, and therefore a large number of edits, we will see repeated Events to the literature, once for every version of the page that makes references. So the number of Events in Wikipedia doesn&rsquo;t mean the number of references.</p>\n<p>An Event is created every time we notice an interaction. Each source (Reddit, Wikipedia, Twitter, blogs, the web at large) has different quirks, and you need to understand the underlying source in order to understand the Events.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-put-the-choice-into-your-hands\">We put the choice into your hands.</h2>\n<p>If you want to create a metric based on counting things, you have a lot of decisions to make. Do you care about bots? Do you care about citation rings? Do you care about retweets? Do you care about whether people use DOIs or article landing pages? Do you care what text people included in their tweet? The answer to each of these questions means that you&rsquo;ll have to look at each data point and decide to put a weighting or score on it.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to measure how blogged about a particular article was, you would have to look at the blogs to work out if they all had unique content. For example, Google&rsquo;s Blogger platform can publish the same blog post under multiple domain names.</p>\n<p>A blog full of link spam is still a blog. You may be doing a study into reputable blogs, so you may want to whitelist the set of domain names to exclude less reputable blogs. Or you may be doing a study into blog spam, so lower quality blogs is precisely what you&rsquo;re interested in,</p>\n<p>If you wanted to measure how discussed an article was on Reddit, you might want to go to the conversation and see if people were actually talking about it, or whether it was an empty discussion. You might want to look at the author of the post to see if they were a regular poster, whether they were a bot or an active member of the community.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to measure how referenced an article was in Wikipedia, you might want to look at the history of each reference to see if it was deleted immediately. Or if it existed for 50% of the time, and to give a weighting.</p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t do any scoring, we just record everything we observe. We know that everyone will have different needs, be producing different outcomes and use different methodologies. So it&rsquo;s important that we tell you everything we know.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s an Event. It&rsquo;s not just a link, it&rsquo;s the observation of a link, coupled with extra information to help you understand it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-know\">How do you know?</h2>\n<p>But what if the Event isn&rsquo;t enough? To come back to the earlier question, &ldquo;how do you know?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Events don&rsquo;t exist in isolation. Data must be collected and processed. Each Agent in Crossref Event Data monitors a particular data source and feeds data into the system, which goes and retrieves webpages so it can make observations. Things can go wrong.</p>\n<p>Any one of these things might prevent an Event from being collected:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We might not know about a particular DOI prefix immediately after it&rsquo;s registered.</li>\n<li>We might not know about a particular landing page domain for a new member immediately.</li>\n<li>Article landing pages might not have the right metadata, so we can&rsquo;t match them to DOIs.</li>\n<li>Article landing pages might block the Crossref bot, so we can&rsquo;t match DOIs.</li>\n<li>Article landing pages might require cookies, or convoluted JavaScript, so the bot can&rsquo;t get the content.</li>\n<li>Blogs and webpages might require cookies or JavaScript to execute.</li>\n<li>Blogs might block the Event Data bot.</li>\n<li>A particular API might have been unavailable for a period of time.</li>\n<li>We didn&rsquo;t know about a particular blog newsfeed at the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a fact of life, and we can only operate on a best-effort basis. If we don&rsquo;t have an Event, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we just give up. Our system generates copious logs. It details every API call it made, the response it got, every scan it made, every URL it looked at. This amounts to about a gigabyte of data per day. If you want to find out why there was no Wikipedia data at a given point in time, you can go back to the log data and see what happened. If you want to see why there was no Event for an article by publisher X, you can look at the logs and see, for example, that Publisher X prevented the bot from visiting.</p>\n<p>Every Event that does exist has a link to an Evidence Record, which corresponds with the logs. The Evidence Record tells you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which version of the Agent was running</li>\n<li>which Artifacts and versions it was working from</li>\n<li>which API requests were made</li>\n<li>which inputs looked like possible links</li>\n<li>which matched or failed</li>\n<li>which Events were generated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Artifacts are versioned files that contain information that Agents use. For example, there&rsquo;s a list of domain names, a list of DOI prefixes, a list of blog feed urls, and so on. By indicating which version of these Artifacts were used, we can explain why we visited a certain domain and not another.</p>\n<p>All the code is open source. The Evidence Record says which version of each Agent was running so you can see precisely which algorithms were used to generate the data.</p>\n<p>Between the Events, Evidence Records, Evidence Logs, Artifacts and Open Source software, we can pinpoint precisely how the system behaved and why. If you have any questions about how a given Event was (or wasn&rsquo;t) generated, every byte of explanation is freely available.</p>\n<p>This forms our &ldquo;Transparency first&rdquo; idea. We start the whole process with an open Artifact Registry. Open source software then produces open Evidence Records. The Evidence Record is then consulted and turned into Events. All the while, copious logs are being generated. We&rsquo;ve designed the system to be transparent, and for each step to be open to inspection.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re currently in Beta. We have over thirty million Events in our API, and they&rsquo;re just waiting for you to use them!</p>\n<p>Head over to the <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a> and get stuck in!</p>\n<p>If you are in Toronto, come and say hi to Maddy or me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/joe-wass/\"><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/staff/joe_720px.jpg\" width=\"200px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/people/madeleine-watson/\"><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/staff/maddy17-720px.png\" width=\"200px\"></a></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Organization Identifier Working Group Update","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/organization-identifier-working-group-update/","published":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000","description":"About 1 year ago, Crossref, DataCite and ORCID [announced a joint initiative] (https://orcid.org/blog/2016/10/31/organization-identifier-project-way-forward) to launch and sustain an open, independent,...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Ed Pentz","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>About 1 year ago, Crossref, DataCite and ORCID [announced a joint initiative] (<a href=\"https://orcid.org/blog/2016/10/31/organization-identifier-project-way-forward\" target=\"_blank\">https://orcid.org/blog/2016/10/31/organization-identifier-project-way-forward</a>) to launch and sustain an open, independent, non-profit organization identifier registry to facilitate the disambiguation of researcher affiliations.

It turns out there are people from all walks of life who care about &ldquo;things&rdquo; using persistent identifiers to link, describe and reference them. There was a great balance between presenters and attendees, and the programme meant that lots of people had a chance to speak. We heard about identifiers for research vessels, pieces of scientific equipment, individual bottles of milk, plus the usual subjects like scholarly publishing, datasets, organisations and funders, and how to cite them.</p>\n<p>Between sessions we chatted over a wide range of subjects, noted similarities between subject areas, offered advice and exchanged ideas.

Launching next month will be support for this new content type, with schema specifically dedicated to the reviews and discussions of scholarly content.</p>\n<p>Not disimilar to other registered resources (datasets, working papers, preprints, translations, etc.) publication peer reviews are important scholarly contributions in their own right and form a part of the scholarly record. In addition to the members who have been registering them, many more are looking to better handle these contributions and give recognition to this process which is so critical to maintaining scientific quality.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples of existing Crossref DOIs for peer reviews: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfracmech.2015.01.019\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfracmech.2015.01.019</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-1-177-2016\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-1-177-2016</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14322/PUBLONS.R518142\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.14322/PUBLONS.R518142</a>.</p>\n<p>We are extending our infrastructure to support all members who make these scholarly discussions available to readers. To accommodate a wide range of publisher practices, this will include a range of outputs made publicly available from the peer review history, across any and all review rounds, including referee reports, decision letters, and author responses. Members will be able to include not only scholarly discussions of journal articles before but also after publication (e.g. “post-publication reviews”).</p>\n<p>Central to this new feature of the Crossref <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration\">Content Registration</a> service is the special set of metadata dedicated to supporting the discovery and investigation of peer reviews as it is linked up to the article discussed. The peer review schema will provide a characterization of the peer review asset (for example: recommendation, type, license, contributor info, competing interests) as well as offer a view into the review process (e.g. pre/post-publication, revision round, review date).</p>\n<h3 id=\"our-custom-support-for-peer-reviews-will-ensure-that\">Our custom support for peer reviews will ensure that:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Readers can see provenance and get context of a work</li>\n<li>Links to this content persist over time</li>\n<li>The metadata is useful</li>\n<li>They are connected to the full history of the published results</li>\n<li>Contributors are given credit for their work (we will ask for ORCID iDs)</li>\n<li>The citation record is clear and up-to-date.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with all the content registered with Crossref, we will make peer review metadata available for machine and human access, across multiple interfaces (e.g. <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a>, <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213679866-OAI-PMH-subscriber-only-\" target=\"_blank\">OAI-PMH</a>, <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref Metadata Search</a>) to enable discoverability across the research ecosystem. This metadata may also support enrichment of scholarly discussion, reviewer accountability, publishing transparency, analysis or research on peer reviews, and so on.</p>\n<p>To reflect the nature of this special content, we will bundle the fees for peer review content fees into the cost of registering the article for members who publish the journal article and its peer reviews. No matter how many reviews are associated with a paper, there will be a fixed fee for the full set.</p>\n<p>Peer review infrastructure will arrive at Crossref in one month, and we are excited to engage our members who want to assign DOIs to peer reviews or migrate previously registered review content to the new schema.

The use of such vocabulary is described in the<a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3443876\" target=\"_blank\"> OCC metadata document</a>, and is implemented by means of the<a href=\"https://w3id.org/oc/ontology\" target=\"_blank\"> OpenCitations Ontology</a> (OCO).</p>\n<p>The OCC resources are made available and accessible in different ways, so as to facilitate their reuse in different contexts:<a href=\"http://opencitations.net/download\" target=\"_blank\"> as monthly dumps</a>, via the<a href=\"https://w3id.org/oc/sparql\" target=\"_blank\"> SPARQL</a> endpoint, and by accessing them directly by means of the HTTP URIs of the stored resources (via content negotiation;<a href=\"https://w3id.org/oc/corpus/br/1\" target=\"_blank\"> example</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us how you are using the Crossref Metadata API at OpenCitations?</strong></p>\n<p>At present, basic citation information is retrieved from PubMed Central, and the Crossref API is then used to retrieve additional metadata describing the citing and cited articles, and to disambiguate bibliographic resources and agents by means of the identifiers retrieved (e.g., DOI, ISSN, ISBN, URL, and Crossref member URL). In future, we will retrieve full citation data direct from Crossref.</p>\n<p><strong>What metadata values do you pull from the API?</strong></p>\n<p>We pull the titles, subtitles, identifiers (e.g. DOI, ISSN, ISBN, URL, and Crossref member URL), author list, publisher, container resources (issue, volume, journal, book, etc.), publication year and pages.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you built your own interface to extract this data?</strong></p>\n<p>The SPAR Citation Indexer, a.k.a.<a href=\"https://w3id.org/oc/paper/spacin-demo-ekaw2016.html\" target=\"_blank\"> SPACIN</a>, is a script and a series of Python classes that allow one to process particular JSON files containing the bibliographic reference lists of papers, produced from the PubMed Central API by another script included in the <a href=\"https://github.com/essepuntato/opencitations\" target=\"_blank\">OpenCitations GitHub repository.</a></p>\n<p>SPACIN processes such JSON files and retrieves additional metadata information about all the citing and cited articles by querying the Crossref API, among others. Once SPACIN has retrieved all these metadata, RDF resources are created (or reused, if they have been already added in the past) and stored in the file system in JSON-LD format. In addition, they are also uploaded to the OCC triplestore (via the SPARQL UPDATE protocol).</p>\n<p><strong>How often do you extract/query data?</strong></p>\n<p>The entire OpenCitations ingestion workflow is running continuously, processing about half a million citations per month.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you do with the metadata once it’s pulled from the API?</strong></p>\n<p>All the metadata relevant to bibliographic entities are stored by using the<a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3443876\" target=\"_blank\"> OCC metadata model</a>. The ontological terms of such metadata model are collected within an ontology called the OpenCitations Ontology (OCO), which includes several terms from the SPAR Ontologies and other vocabularies. In particular, the following six bibliographic entity types occur in the datasets created by SPACIN:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>bibliographic resources (br), class fabio:Expression – resources that either cite or are cited by other bibliographic resources (e.g. journal articles), or that contain such citing/cited resources (e.g. journals);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>resource embodiments (re), class fabio:Manifestation – details of the physical or digital forms in which the bibliographic resources are made available by their publishers;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bibliographic entries (be), class biro:BibliographicReference – literal textual bibliographic entries occurring in the reference lists of bibliographic resources;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>responsible agents (ra), class foaf:Agent – names of agents having certain roles with respect to the bibliographic resources (i.e. names of authors, editors, publishers, etc.);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>agent roles (ar), class pro:RoleInTime – roles held by agents with respect to the bibliographic resources (e.g. author, editor, publisher);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>identifiers (id), class datacite:Identifier – external identifiers (e.g. DOI, ORCID, PubMedID) associated to bibliographic resources and agents.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Do you have plans to enhance your metadata input?</strong></p>\n<p>We already handle additional information, such as ORCIDs, that are extracted by means of the ORCID API applied to the citing and cited articles included in the OCC. In addition, we are developing scripts in order to use all the new citation data Crossref now makes available as consequence of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC).</p>\n<p><strong>What are the future plans for OpenCitations?</strong></p>\n<p>With funding received from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, we will shortly extend the current infrastructure and the rate of data ingest. Our immediate goal is to increment the daily ingestion of citation data from about half a million citations per month to about half a million citations per day. In addition, we plan to analyse the OCC so as to understand the quality of its current data, and to develop new user interfaces, including graph visualizations of citation networks, that will expand the means whereby users can interact with the OpenCitations data.</p>\n<p><strong>What else would you like to see our REST API offer?</strong></p>\n<p>Categorising articles/journals/any bibliographic resources according to their main discipline (Computer Science, Biology, etc.) and, eventually, by means of subject terms and/or keywords. Additionally, provision of authors&rsquo; institutional affiliations and funder information would be extremely valuable.</p>\n<p>Thank you Silvio and David!</p>\n<p>If you are keen to share what you’re doing with the our Metadata APIs, contact <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">feedback@crossref.org</a> and share your story.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"LIVE17 in Singapore is taking shape!","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/live17-in-singapore-is-taking-shape/","published":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Our annual meeting on 14th and 15th November, LIVE17 is shaping up nicely with an exciting line-up of respected speakers talking around the theme of “Metadata + Infrastructure + Relations = Context”, with...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Ginny Hendricks","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>Our annual meeting on 14th and 15th November, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual\">LIVE17</a> is shaping up nicely with an exciting line-up of respected speakers talking around the theme of “Metadata + Infrastructure + Relations = Context”, with each half day covering some element of the main theme.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day one, AM: <em>Metadata enables connections</em></li>\n<li>Day one, PM: <em>How research and infrastructure is changing</em></li>\n<li>Day two, AM: <em>Social challenges in the scholarly community</em></li>\n<li>Day two, PM: <em>Who is using your metadata and what are they doing with it?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This years updated format means both days will be packed with a mixture of plenary and breakout sessions and interactive activities.

But scholarly communications are becoming much more dynamic, with versions posted as &lsquo;preprints&rsquo; before publication, corrections after publication, and potentially multiple versions of the same study appearing at different times. How should we handle this changing landscape for the benefits of researchers and consumers of the literature?</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-theodora-bloom\">About Theodora Bloom</h3>\n<p>Theodora Bloom has been executive editor of The BMJ since June 2014. She has a PhD in developmental cell biology from the University of Cambridge and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School. She moved into publishing as an editor on the biology team at Nature, and in 1992 joined the fledgling journal Current Biology. After a number of years helping to develop Current Biology and its siblings Structure and Chemistry &amp; Biology, Theo joined the beginnings of the open access movement. As the founding editor of Genome Biology she was closely involved in the birth of the commercial open access publisher BioMed Central. She joined the non-profit open access publisher Public Library of Science (PLOS) in 2008, first as chief editor of PLOS Biology and later as biology editorial director. She took the lead for PLOS on issues around data access and availability and launched PLOS&rsquo;s data sharing policy. At The BMJ she is responsible for operations, delivering the journal online and in print.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a id=\"CG\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"casey-greene---research-and-literature-parasites-in-a-culture-of-sharing\">Casey Greene - Research and literature parasites in a culture of sharing.</h3>\n<p>Casey has been a strong champion of preprints and will discuss his efforts in this area including resources that he has shared to help advance the spread of preprints not only amongst researchers but publishers. These include letters to respond to journals that invite reviews but have unclear preprint policies. His lab members have also analyzed the licensing of preprints and the coverage of literature provided by the pirate repository, Sci-Hub. His talk will touch on each of these areas, and also a discussion of the Research Parasite and Symbiont Awards, which aim to advance recognition for data sharing and reuse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-casey-greene\">About Casey Greene</h3>\n<p>Casey is an assistant professor in the Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the Childhood Cancer Data Lab for Alex&rsquo;s Lemonade Stand Foundation. His lab develops deep learning methods that integrate distinct large-scale datasets to extract the rich and intrinsic information embedded in such integrated data. Before starting the Integrative Genomics Lab in 2012, Casey earned his PhD for his study of gene-gene interactions in the field of computational genetics from Dartmouth College in 2009 and moved to the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow from 2009-2012. The overarching theme of his work has been the development and evaluation of methods that acknowledge the emergent complexity of biological systems.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a id=\"LT\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"leonid-teytelman---call-to-reduce-random-collisions-with-information-we-can-automatically-connect-scientists-to-the-knowledge-that-they-need\">Leonid Teytelman - Call to reduce random collisions with information; we can automatically connect scientists to the knowledge that they need.</h3>\n<p>Every scientist knows that virtually all papers, including their own, contain mistakes. A key motivation for creating protocols.io was to make it possible to share corrections and optimizations of published research protocols and to have this information automatically reach the scientists using these methods. While pushing relevant knowledge to the users is built into all aspects of protocols.io, we can do a lot more. If publishers, Crossref, and reference management platforms collaborate, we can move beyond the search towards a point where important information automatically reaches the appropriate researchers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-leonid-lenny-teytelman\">About Leonid (Lenny) Teytelman</h3>\n<p>Lenny is the Co-founder and CEO of protocols.io, an open access platform to share and discover research protocols. It enables scientists to make, exchange, improve and discuss protocols and it is poised to dramatically accelerate and to increase reproducibility of scientific research. Lenny did his graduate studies at UC Berkeley and finished his postdoctoral research at MIT. Lenny has a strong passion for sharing science and improving research efficiency through technology.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a id=\"NB\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"nicholas-bailey---what-does-data-science-tell-us-about-social-challenges-in-scholarly-publishing\">Nicholas Bailey - What does data science tell us about social challenges in scholarly publishing?</h3>\n<p>How can we facilitate the fair advancement and dissemination of knowledge? The risks and shortcomings within scholarly publishing are always under scrutiny, but some problems don’t seem to be going away. What should we do about obvious gender inequality within some disciplines, or the weight given to Impact Factor as a measure of quality? The Royal Society of Chemistry has a royal charter to publish scientific content in a way that serves the public interest, and as such its Data Science team devotes part of its time to analysing the social challenges facing scholarly publishing. In this talk, Nicholas Bailey will share some examples.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-nicholas-bailey\">About Nicholas Bailey</h3>\n<p>Nicholas Bailey is a web analytics expert, a swimmer, a father, and a data geek. After spending several years in the Marketing team at the Royal Society of Chemistry, ultimately managing the database marketing team, he moved out of Marketing and into the Data Science team in order to work more closely with agile teams of developers and strengthen his data analysis and coding skills. Nicholas has a lot to say about measuring digital products, machine learning, and the potential of data science to contribute to positive social outcomes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a id=\"MV\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"miguel-escobar-varela---digital-humanities-in-singapore-some-thoughts-for-the-future\">Miguel Escobar Varela - Digital Humanities in Singapore: some thoughts for the future.</h3>\n<p>Singapore-based researchers from a variety of disciplines are currently using digital tools to study the humanities, in areas as diverse as history and dance studies. This talk will present an overview of current projects and suggest a path for the growth of this field in Singapore. It argues that the future of DH requires better inter-institutional infrastructure for long-term data storage, clearer protocols for interoperability and more freely available and reusable datasets. This is easier said than done, but looking at the examples of other countries can provide some sources for inspiration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-miguel-escobar-varela\">About Miguel Escobar Varela</h3>\n<p>Miguel Escobar Varela is an assistant professor in the University Scholars Programme (USP) at the National University of Singapore. At the USP, Dr. Varela teaches in the domain of Humanities and Social Sciences. He is a theatre researcher and software programmer.

Not only has machine surpassed humans in playing the chess game Go and Jeopardy game shows, reports of superhuman performance in other highly cognitive tasks, ranging from image classification to speech recognition, also abound. Have we reached a stage where the advancements in AI can help tackle a problem in scientific pursuits, namely, the access and the dissemination of scholarly knowledge? This talk describes Microsoft Academic, a project inside Microsoft Research that uses the state-of-the-art AI in natural language understanding and knowledge acquisition to harvest knowledge from scholarly communications and make it available on the web. The talk will describe the technical challenges that have been overcome, the world-wide research collaborations that have since been enabled, and discuss the potentials of making knowledge more readily available to the mass.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-kuansan-wang\">About Kuansan Wang</h3>\n<p>Kuansan Wang is the Managing Director at Microsoft Research Outreach (MSR), where he started in March 1998 as a Researcher in the speech technology group working. In 2004, he moved to the speech product group and became a software architect where he helped create and ship the product Microsoft Speech Server, which is still powering the corporate call center for Microsoft. Since September 2007, he has been back at MSR, joining the newly founded Internet Service Research Center with a mission to revolutionize online services and make Web more intelligent.

At the July meeting the board typically spends a significant amount of time on strategic planning in addition to its usual activities such as financial oversight, approving investment in new services based on staff and committee recommendations, reviewing and approving policies and fees for new and existing services and generally making sure Crossref is healthy and well run.</p>\n<p>This year we worked with a facilitator to look farther into the future than normal using a technique called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning\" target=\"_blank\">scenario planning</a> to map out “strategic agendas” for the next five years. Scenario-based strategic planning doesn’t try to predict the future but allows us to be flexible in planning by looking at a range of different possible eventualities. This is particularly useful for Crossref because scholarly research and communications is changing rapidly and we operate in a very complex environment.</p>\n<p>To prepare for the meeting our facilitator, Susan Stickely, prepared 12 “critical uncertainties” - impactful issues that could go either way and that will affect how Crossref works, its mission and even whether it needs to exist. To develop the critical uncertainties Susan interviewed Crossref staff, board members, general members and scholarly communications community influencers and we held a preparatory group exercise at the March board meeting. The critical uncertainties are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Scholarly Communication Landscape</strong>: Increasing diversity? Or publishing disintermediated?</li>\n<li><strong>Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Supporting? Or obsoleting the researcher and publishers?</li>\n<li><strong>Policy and Regulation</strong>: Limiting? Or visionary?</li>\n<li><strong>Financing of Scholarly Communication</strong>: Shrinking Pool? Or Expanding Pool?</li>\n<li><strong>Rise of Pre-print, New Content Sources</strong>: New, non-traditional? Or De-formalizing?</li>\n<li><strong>Tracking and Privacy</strong>: Increased Privacy? Or Loss of Privacy?</li>\n<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: Secure? Or Vulnerable, Insecure?</li>\n<li><strong>Publisher Sustainability</strong>: Slow Progress? Or Fast Progress?</li>\n<li><strong>Impact of Open</strong>: Open or Closed? Or Slow to Change?</li>\n<li><strong>Source of Prestige and Recognition</strong>: New Source? Or Publisher, Institution?</li>\n<li><strong>Quality and Accuracy of Content</strong>: High? Or Low?</li>\n<li><strong>Geopolitical Stability and Stance</strong>: Stable, Unified? Or Unstable, Fragmented</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition, from the interviews Susan was able to summarize Crossref’s distinctive competencies as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having a reputation as a trusted, neutral one-stop source of metadata and services</li>\n<li>Managing scholarly infrastructure with technical knowledge and innovation</li>\n<li>Convening and facilitating scholarly communications community collaboration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be successful Crossref will need to continue to invest in, apply, and evolve these distinctive competencies and strategic dilemmas and challenges.</p>\n<p>Over a day and half of discussions and breakout sessions the board and staff drew up a number of scenarios and created a draft strategic agenda for Crossref. Over the next couple of months we’ll be working on refining the strategic agenda and will be presenting the results to members in the next couple of months.</p>\n<p>One theme that emerged is for Crossref to engage more with funders and build on the work with done with them in creating the Crossref Funder Registry. We have started a new <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders\">Funder Advisory Group</a> and, among other things, are working with them on a prototype for a new registry of grant identifiers.</p>\n<p>In the regular board session the board approved three recommendations from the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/\">Membership and Fees Committee</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To approve the recommendations with respect to volume discounts for current deposits of posted content (i.e. preprints).</li>\n<li>To create a new “peer review report” content type with a specific metadata schema and a bundled fee of $1.25 to be charged for a content item and all the reports associated with it.</li>\n<li>To update the metadata delivery offering to have a single agreement that covers all metadata APIs/delivery routes, to adopt a single (updated) fee structure, and to remove case-by-case opt-outs for metadata.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Item number 3 involves a number of big changes - for example the removal of the case-by-case opt outs requires a change to the main Membership Agreement - so we will be sending out more information to members and Affiliates in September and October about the changes and our implementation plans.</p>\n<p>You can see the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#motions\">full history of the motions from every Board meeting</a> on our website.</p>\n<p>Another major issue that the board discussed is the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/elections/\">election for the board of directors</a>. In order to broaden participation and be inclusive there was a new process this year. The Nominating Committee put out a call for expressions of interest for candidates to be on the slate for the election. We had a great response and there were 25 expressions of interest reviewed by the Nominating Committee who came up with a slate of nine excellent candidates for the six seats up for election. This is the first time that there are more candidates than seats on the slate so it’s particularly important for members to vote this year. See the recent <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/2017-election-slate/\">blog post about the election process and the slate</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>The next board meeting is in November in conjunction with <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual/\">Crossref LIVE17 in Singapore</a>.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Coming to a venue near you","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/coming-to-a-venue-near-you/","published":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000","description":"First of all – hello!

And whilst I&rsquo;m reluctant to draw too many parallels between the petrochemical industry and scholarly publishing, there are some interesting comparisons to be drawn.</p>\n<p>Oil starts its life deep underground as an amorphous sticky substance. Prospectors must identify oil fields, drill, extract the oil and refine it. It finds its way into things as diverse as aspirin, paint and hammocks. And as I lie in my hammock watching paint dry, I&rsquo;m curious to know how crude oil made its way into the aspirin that I’ve taken for the headache brought on by the paint fumes. Whilst it would be better if I did know how these things were made, not knowing doesn&rsquo;t impair the efficacy of my aspirin.</p>\n<p>Altmetrics start life deep inside a number of systems. Data buried in countless blogs, social media and web platforms must be identified, extracted and refined before it can be used in products like impact assessments, prompts to engagement, and even tenure decisions. But there the similarity ends. Like the benzene in my aspirin, the data that goes into my favourite metric has come a long way from its origins. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I shouldn&rsquo;t know how it was made. In fact, knowing what went into it can help me reason about it, explain it and even improve it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heavy-industry-or-backyard-refinery\">Heavy industry or backyard refinery?</h3>\n<p>When you head out to fill your car, you buy fuel from a company that probably did the whole job itself. It found the crude oil, extracted it, refined it, transported it and pumped it into your car. Of course there are exceptions, but a lot of fuel is made by vertically integrated companies who do the whole job. And whilst there are research scientists who brew up special batches for one-off pieces of research, if you wanted to make a batch of fuel for yourself you&rsquo;d have to set up your own back-yard fractional distillation column.</p>\n<p>Because the collection of a huge amount of data must be boiled down into altmetrics, organisations who want to produce these metrics have a big job to do. They must find data sources, retrieve the data, process it and produce the end product. The foundation of altmetrics is the measurement of impact, and whilst the intermediary data is very interesting, the ultimate goal of a metric is the end product. If you wanted to make a new metric you&rsquo;d have two choices: set up an oil refinery (i.e. build a whole new system, complete with processing pipeline) or a back-yard still (a one-off research item). Either option involves going out and querying different systems, processing the data and producing an output.</p>\n<p>Being able to demonstrate the provenance of a given measurement is important because no measurement is perfect. It&rsquo;s impossible to query every single extant source out there. And even if you could, it would be impossible to prove that you had. And even then, the process of refinement isn&rsquo;t always faultless. Every measurement out there has a story behind it, and being able to tell that story is important when using the measurement for something important. Data sources and algorithms change over time, and comparing a year-old measurement to one made today might be difficult without knowing what underlying observations went into it. A solution to this is complete transparency about the source data, how it was processed, and how it relates to the output.</p>\n<h3 id=\"underlying-data\">Underlying data</h3>\n<p>This is where Crossref comes in. It turns out that the underlying data that goes into altmetrics is just our kind of thing. As the DOI Registration Agency for scholarly literature, it&rsquo;s our job to work with publishers to keep track of everything that&rsquo;s published, assign DOIs and be the central collection and storage point for metadata and links. Examples of links stored in Crossref are between articles and funders, clinical trial numbers, preprints, datasets etc. With the Event Data project, we are now collecting links between places on the web and our registered content when they&rsquo;re made via DOIs or article landing pages.</p>\n<p>This data has wider use than just than altmetrics. For example, an author might want to know over what time period a link to their article was included in Wikipedia, and which edit to the article was responsible for removing it and why. Or, in these days of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;, someone may want to know everywhere on Twitter that a particular study is referenced so they can engage in conversation.</p>\n<p>Whilst the field of altmetrics was the starting point for this project, our goal isn’t to provide any kind of metric. Instead, we provide a stream of Events that occurred concerning a given piece of registered content with a DOI. If you want to build a metric out of it, you&rsquo;re welcome to. There are a million different things you could build out of the data, and each will have a different methodology. By providing this underlying data set, we hope we&rsquo;ve found the right level of abstraction to enable people to build a wide range of things.</p>\n<p>Every different end-product will use different data and use different algorithms. By providing an open dataset at the right level of granularity, we allow the producers of these end-products to say exactly which input data they were working with. By making the data open, we allow anyone else to duplicate the data if they wish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sticky-mess\">Sticky mess</h3>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2017/refinery.png\" style=\"float: right\">\n<p>To finish, let me return to the sticky mess of the distillation column. We identify sources (websites, APIs and RSS feeds). We visit each one, and collect data. We process that data into Events. And we provide Events via an API. At each stage of processing, we make the data open:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Artifact Registry lists all of the sources, RSS feeds and domains we query.</li>\n<li>The Evidence Registry lists which sites we visited, what input we got, what version of each Artifact was used, and which Events were produced.</li>\n<li>The Evidence Log describes exactly what every part of the system did, including if it ran into problems along the way.</li>\n<li>The Events link back to the Evidence so you can trace exactly what activity led up to the Event.</li>\n<li>All the code is open source and the version is linked in the Evidence Record, so you can see precisely which algorithms were used to generate a given Event.</li>\n<li>Anyone using the Data can link back to Events, which in turn link back to their Evidence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The end-product, Events, can be used to answer altmetrics-y questions like &ldquo;who tweeted my article?&rdquo;. But the layers below that can be put to a range of other uses. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;Why does publisher X have a lower Twitter count?&rdquo;. The Evidence Logs might show that they tend to block bots from their site, preventing data from being collected.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Why did their Twitter count rise?&rdquo;. The Evidence Logs might show that they stopped blocking bots.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What does Crossref think the DOI is for landing page X?&rdquo;. A search of the Evidence Logs might show that the Event Data system visited the page on a given date and decided that it corresponded to DOI Y.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Which domains hold DOI landing pages?&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Domains&rdquo; Artifact will show the domains that Event Data looked at, and the Evidence Logs will show which versions were used over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By producing not only Events, but being completely transparent about the refinement process, we hope that people can build things beyond traditional altmetrics, and also make use of the intermediary products as well. And by using open licenses, we allow reuse of the data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"see-you-in-toronto\">See you in Toronto!</h3>\n<p>There&rsquo;s so much more to say but I&rsquo;ve run out of ink.

The platform is included in the CLA annual licence fee and is an optional tool for licensees.</p>\n<p>At its core, the system is a searchable repository of digital copies that have been created under the licence by HEIs (the CLA Digital Content Store), it also functions as a workflow management tool. When extracts are digitised by HEIs under the CLA Licence, they are uploaded directly to the DCS. Once an extract is uploaded and assigned to a course, students are able to access the extract via a secure link. Every year HEIs are obliged to report all of these digitised items to CLA as part of the terms of their copyright blanket licence. Prior to the DCS, HEIs were having to submit this data manually, a process that could take days, if not weeks. The system removes the need for annual census reporting to CLA, reducing the data collection burden on the HE sector and creating administrative efficiencies through streamlining the digital course pack creation process.<br></p>\n<p><span ><b>Can you talk about how you&rsquo;re using the <a href=\"https://www.cla.co.uk/blog-crossref-api#_msocom_1\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref REST API</a> within CLA Digital Content Store (DCS)?</b></span></p>\n<p>When a DCS user adds a new extract to a course they need to include relevant metadata. This metadata is necessary, as it ultimately helps CLA in correctly identifying the copyright owner of the extract so that we can make sure they receive fair payment in our royalties distributions.\nThe Crossref REST API supplies the DCS user with article and journal metadata so that they can provide the correct information about the content they are uploading. Using the API saves the user the time they would have otherwise spent searching for this data, streamlining their workflow and making the process more efficient.</p>\n<p>Searching for and adding content in the DCS\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/CLA_blog.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p>\n<p><span ><b>What are your future development plans?</b></span></p>\n<p>We’re continuing to develop the DCS in order to improve user experience for our customers. We’re currently looking into opening up access for our users by allowing academics to submit requests to\nthe DCS via a web-form and our own DCS Course Content URL API. We are also looking into incorporating the Crossref REST API into some of our back office workflows to improve efficiency and simplify our workflow.

Today, the artist formerly known as CrossCheck provides our members with cost-effective access to Turnitin’s powerful text comparison tool, <a href=\"https://www.ithenticate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">iThenticate</a>.</p>\n<p>Fast forward nearly a decade, and it’s wonderful to see just how Similarity Check membership has grown in the nine years since launch; from 16 original members in 2008 to over 1,300 today.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/Sim Check member graph_Fig 1.1.png\" alt=\"Membership graph\" width=\"800px\" height=\"450\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p><em>Figure 1.1 The number of publishers participating in the Similarity Check service each year between 2008 – 2017 (to April)</em></p>\n<br>\nUsage of iThenticate is also consistent with this growth in membership, and throughout 2016 our members checked over four million manuscripts for similarity using the tool. As Similarity Check members contribute their full-text content into Turnitin’s database, this increase in membership also has a dramatic impact on the volume of content indexed by Turnitin. Today, members can compare their manuscripts against Turnitin’s database of over 60 million full-text works provided by Similarity Check members. With over 88 million works currently registered with Crossref, this means that 68% of all content deposited with us is now available for comparison in iThenticate.\n<p>Over the years we have worked very closely with Turnitin to help champion new iThenticate feature developments that best support our member’s use of the tool as a core function of their editorial workflow. Many of our members too have also worked together with Turnitin to provide feedback on user experience and design.</p>\n<p>Below, Turnitin’s Product Manager for iThenticate, Sun Oh, shares an insight into their research process and how Similarity Check member’s feedback has been critical in developing new and improved functionality in iThenticate.</p>\n<p><strong>Read on to learn more from Sun&hellip;</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/turnitin-logo-primary-rgb.png\" alt=\"Turnitin logo\" width=\"400px\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p><em>Sun Oh is a Senior Product Manager at Turnitin. She is currently the Product Manager for iThenticate and backend systems including the Content Intake System and similarity reports.</em></p>\n<br>\nLast year we surveyed our Crossref customers to find out what Similarity Check improvements they would like to see and noticed a recurring request for the ability to compare two or more personally sourced documents.\n<p>We were intrigued and decided to run with it. We contacted the respondents who had asked for this, and started conversations to find out more. This helped us gather invaluable data, which in turn helped us to build the feature based on real use cases and with a clear view of what was wanted.</p>\n<p>The design prototypes were reviewed for usability and effectiveness each step of the way by the respondents and once we had the feature up and running, those who requested it in our initial survey were among the first to trial it.</p>\n<p>We’re thrilled to announce that we’ve now launched the new Doc-to-Doc comparison feature, available through iThenticate’s native interface. Simply select the Doc-to-Doc comparison upload method from the document submission panel.</p>\n<p>If you are a Crossref member using Similarity Check, you have exclusive early access to this new feature, which allows you to use iThenticate’s powerful similarity check functionality and apply it to your own, private documents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-doc-to-doc-comparison-work\">How does Doc-to-Doc Comparison work?</h2>\n<p>Doc-to-Doc comparison allows users to upload one primary document and compare it against up to five other documents.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/SimCheck_Doc-to-doc_ Fig 1.2.png\" alt=\"Doc-to-Doc Comparison screenshot\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p><em>Figure 1.2 The document upload screen for Doc-to-Doc comparison</em></p>\n<br>\nWhen the upload is complete, a similarity score is generated for the primary document based on the amount of similar content found in the comparison documents. A full comparison report is also available.\n<p>The comparison report will open in the document viewer, and will display the primary document along with a list of the comparison documents and with their similarity percentage. If one of the comparison documents doesn’t include text that matches the primary document, iThenticate will still display it anyway, with a 0% score, allowing users to rule it out of their inspection. The similarity report will be stored securely in the user’s folder until they delete it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/SimCheck_Doc-to-doc_Fig 1.3.png\" alt=\"Document viewer screenshot\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p><em>Figure 1.3 Similarity report for Doc-to-Doc comparison</em></p>\n<br>\nAs these documents will not be stored in a shared database, they won’t affect the similarity score of any future submissions. Primary and comparison documents remain completely private and will not be indexed into the shared iThenticate content database.\n<p>To get a better idea of how Doc-to-Doc comparison works, check out the <a href=\"https://guides.turnitin.com/iThenticate/Doc-to-Doc_Comparison\" target=\"_blank\">iThenticate feature guide </a>on the Turnitin website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-using-doc-to-doc-comparison-now\">Start using Doc-to-Doc Comparison now!</h2>\n<p>If you’re a Crossref member using Similarity Check, you can log in to your iThenticate account now and select the Doc-to-Doc comparison link on the homepage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-is-new-in-ithenticate-in-this-new-release\">What else is new in iThenticate in this new release?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"new-look\">New Look</h3>\n<p>In addition to Doc-to-Doc comparison, we decided to refresh the look and feel of iThenticate; the same tools our users know and trust, now with a modern interface. Users will also notice that iThenticate now has more readable font and friendlier styling throughout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"report-mode-memory\">Report Mode Memory</h3>\n<p>To make life easier, iThenticate now remembers whether users were in the All Sources or Match Overview mode when they last used the Document Viewer. iThenticate will then open documents in this mode automatically hereafter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-submission-process\">Improved Submission Process</h3>\n<p>We’re also enhancing our submission process by making the upload requirements more inclusive. We’ve increased the possible file size limit from 40MB to 100MB when uploading to either the database or to Doc-to-Doc comparison, and PowerPoint (.ppt) and Excel (.xlsm) file formats are now accepted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"developments-completed-in-2016\">Developments completed in 2016</h2>\n<p>If Similarity Check members haven’t had a chance to check out the improvements we introduced in iThenticate throughout 2016, here’s a quick recap. You can always find our updates on the What&rsquo;s New page of the iThenticate website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"download-user-list\">Download User List</h3>\n<p>The ability for administrators to download a list of all the users in their account has been added. This list will allow administrators to easily send emails to users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"similarity-score-calculation-update\">Similarity Score Calculation Update</h3>\n<p>We updated how the similarity score is calculated when bibliographic material is excluded from a similarity report. Now, when bibliography exclusion is enabled, the word count of the bibliography is not included when calculating the overall percentage. This update to the similarity report calculation helps to provide users with a more accurate similarity score.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-security\">Improved Security</h3>\n<p>We are fully committed to keeping user’s data safe and secure at all times. To that end, we’ve added additional security logging, put in measures to enforce stronger passwords, and enabled Captcha after failed login attempts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faster-report-generation\">Faster Report Generation</h3>\n<p>We’ve increased the number of resources dedicated to the generation of similarity reports for our iThenticate service. As a result, users should see faster turnaround times for similarity reports.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-eight-additional-languages\">Support for Eight Additional Languages</h3>\n<p>The iThenticate user interface is now available in eight additional languages: German, Dutch, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, French, and both Simplified &amp; Traditional Chinese. When adding new users to an account, administrators can specify the language of the new user, which will then send a welcome email in the selected language. Individual users can also set their preferred language by selecting a language from the Language dropdown in the Settings menu.</p>\n<h3 id=\"content-intake-system\">Content Intake System</h3>\n<p>We’ve developed a new Content Intake System which enables our publication content database to scale so that our users can compare against a constantly growing database of the most recently published content. This allows us to index Similarity Check members’ data in a much more reliable and efficient way than legacy intake methods. And recently, we’ve made the collecting and processing of content from Crossref members using Similarity Check even faster by parallelising our processors. This means that we have more processors running simultaneously to process data.</p>\n<p>By removing the need for crawling, we will also minimize our impact on traffic to a Similarity Check member’s public-facing website. The Content Intake System is able to directly collect full text URLs from members DOI metadata. This results in a huge reduction in the time it takes from when a publisher first deposits a new DOI with Crossref, to when the content is indexed by us into our full-text publication database. To date, we’ve been able to index the content associated with 60 million Crossref DOIs, and have indexed more than 165 million published works in total which submissions are compared against in iThenticate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"walker-web-crawler\">Walker (web crawler)</h3>\n<p>We’ve developed a new web crawler. Referred to as “Walker”, the crawler makes it possible to provide quicker and more reliable similarity matches to content available on the web. Not to be confused with the Content Intake System mentioned above, Walker’s purpose is to crawl the public web and is not used for indexing full-text content from Similarity Check members.</p>\n<p>Using Walker, we’re adding an average of nearly 10 million new web pages to our content database per day, ensuring we have the freshest internet content available to find matches against.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wed-love-to-get-your-feedback\">We’d love to get your feedback!</h2>\n<p>As we design and develop new features, we want to make sure we’re fully understanding Similarity Check member’s needs and would love the opportunity to engage with users for further research.

Monroe, H. Han, P. Shen, et. al.</em></p>\n<p>Almost five years on and I feel we have still not cracked it! We have signed up to the <a href=\"https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final\" target=\"_blank\">Force11 data citation principles</a>, which were published three years back; we have been actively involved in working groups of Force11 and others, for example the <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/19/100784\" target=\"_blank\">Data Citation Roadmap for Scientific Publishers</a> and the JATS XML <a href=\"http://jats4r.org/data-citations\" target=\"_blank\">data citation recommendation</a> of <a href=\"http://jats4r.org\" target=\"_blank\">JATS4R</a>. I am also currently working with other publishers to come up with recommended JATS XML tagging for data availability statements, which is easier said than done considering the nuances of dataset uses and also how different publishers approach this.</p>\n<p>Added to this, there is still significant push-back from authors about putting all dataset citations in the reference list (for example, authors are concerned about self-citing by citing a dataset created as part of the research article; “dataset citations” that are in effect a link to a search results page on a database; and the necessitation of hundreds of reference entries if an author has used a large base for the research).</p>\n<p>While eLife is very active in this space, and aims to arrange and mark up the datasets and citations produced by our authors in line with recommendations, the recommendations still have some gaps and the complete picture is not yet clear.</p>\n<p>In late 2014, we brought in-house the process of depositing Crossref metadata (previously our online host did this for us). It gave us control of our processes and, at the time, we sent all the information we could to Crossref and have ensured our references are open and available in the Crossref public API. The code for this conversion process is all open-source and available for reuse. It can be <a href=\"https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-crossref-feed\" target=\"_blank\">found on GitHub</a>. Since then, besides small improvements to the code and troubleshooting problems, we’ve not updated the code. I have been keeping a list of Crossref features and new deposit metadata we can add to our deposits, and now is the time for us to start working on this again.</p>\n<p>One of the items we’ll be addressing is data citations.</p>\n<p>The Crossref reference schema does not cater well for non-book or -journal content, and if an item does not have a DOI, the “reference” is not very useful because of the few tags available in the Crossref schema.</p>\n<p>However, Crossref have introduced the relationship type to their schema, so data references can be well linked and mineable. As I see Crossref as a potential broker between publishers and data repositories in the future, using the relationship-type deposit for all datasets will assist this and also allow these data points to more easily be seen within the article Nexus framework (see the recent blog post, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/how-do-you-deposit-data-citations/\">How do you deposit data citations?</a>).</p>\n<p>At eLife, we already distinguish between Dataset generated as part of research results (relationship type in the Crossref schema: “isSupplementedBy”) and Dataset produced by a different set of researchers or previously published (relationship type: “references”). Therefore, it will not be hard for us to convert all the information about data referencing that is within the dataset section into a relationship-type deposit in the conversion to Crossref XML.</p>\n<p>We have also recently gone through an exercise of defining a set of rules for all our references and, of the 12 allowed types, one is data. The rules for Schematron (a rule-based validation language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in XML trees; see also this useful <a href=\"http://jats4r.org/schematron-a-handy-xml-tool-thats-not-just-for-villains\" target=\"_blank\">article about Schematron</a> on the JATS4R learning centre) have been written for the eLife ‘business’ rules. Subject to final testing, these will be integrated into our workflow (the Schematron is open source and available for reuse on <a href=\"https://github.com/elifesciences/reference-schematron\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>, and we will also build an API for people to use the Schematron direct). This will allow us to easily identify all data references and convert them into relationship types in the XML delivered to Crossref. This way, they will not be lost in the references section of our deposits, but properly identified.</p>\n<p>However, we do appreciate this will become harder for us as authors become more familiar with datasets as references, because we will not be able to identify the difference between generated and analysed datasets so easily.</p>\n<p>The code developed and used to complete these conversions will, again, be on Github and open source, and we actively encourage the reuse of this.</p>\n<p>While the industry is still working on the best way to deal with data and ensuring it is given the prominence it requires, we feel this is the best approach we can take. Nothing is forever and we can still change what we do in the future. The beauty of open-source code also means that if there is an alternative approach now or in the future, the code we wrote at eLife can be developed by someone else in the future and we can all benefit.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:feedback@crossref.org\">contact us</a>.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Want to be on our Board?","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/want-to-be-on-our-board/","published":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Do you want to affect change for the scholarly community?

This is part of the **existing Content Registration ** process and requires no new workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"relationships\">Relationships</h2>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/data_article_nexus_short.png\" alt=\"An exemplary image\" width=\"500px\" />\n</div>\n<p>Data &amp; software citations are a valuable part of the “<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-article-nexus-linking-publications-to-associated-research-outputs/\">research article nexus</a>”, comprised of the publication linked to a variety of associated research objects, including data and software, supporting information, protocols, videos, published peer reviews, a preprint, conference papers, etc. For all of these resources, we use relation types in the metadata deposit to “anchor” the article in the article nexus and link to it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-data--software-we-ask-for\">For data &amp; software, we ask for:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>identifier of the dataset/software</li>\n<li>identifier type: “DOI”, “Accession”, “PURL”, “ARK”, “URI”, “Other” *</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214357426\" target=\"_blank\">relationship type</a>: “isSupplementedBy” or “references”</li>\n<li>description of dataset or software.\n<br/>\n*<em>Additional identifier types beyond those used for data or software are also accepted, including ARXIV, ECLI, Handle, ISSN, ISBN, PMID, PMCID, and UUID.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crossref maintains an expansive set of relationship types to support the various resources linked in the research article nexus. For data and software, we recommend “isSupplementedBy” and “references” as relationship types in the metadata. Use the former if it was generated de novo as part of the research results. For those generated by another project and then reused, we recommend applying “references” in the relationship type. These were selected in consultation with DataCite and data working groups. They will provide the level of specificity requested by the community.</p>\n<p>To illustrate how to represent the link within the metadata deposit, we offer two examples from two popular dataset identifiers, one for each of the relationship types.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dataset</th>\n<th>Snippet of deposit XML containing link</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dataset with DOI:</strong> <br/> Data from: Extreme genetic structure in a social bird species despite high dispersal capacity. <br/> <strong>Database:</strong> Dryad Digital Repository<br/><strong>DOI:</strong> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.684v0\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.684v0</a></td>\n<td><code>&lt;program xmlns=&quot;http://www.crossref.org/relations.xsd&quot;&gt;</code> <br/> <code>&lt;related_item&gt;</code> <br/> <code>&lt;description&gt;Data from: Extreme genetic structure in a social bird species despite high dispersal capacity&lt;/description&gt;</code> <br/> <code>&lt;inter_work_relation relationship-type=&quot;isSupplementedBy&quot; identifier-type=&quot;doi&quot;&gt;10.5061/dryad.684v0&lt;/inter_work_relation&gt;</code> <br/> <code>&lt;/related_item&gt;</code> <br/> <code>&lt;/program&gt;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dataset with accession number:</strong><br/> NKX2-5 mutations causative for congenital heart disease retain functionality and are directed to hundreds of targets <br/><strong>Database:</strong> Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) <br/> <strong>Accession number:</strong> GSE44902 <br/> <strong>URL:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE44902\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE44902</a></td>\n<td><code>&lt;program xmlns=&quot;http://www.crossref.org/relations.xsd&quot;&gt;</code> <br/> <code>&lt;related_item&gt;</code> <br/> <code>&lt;description&gt;NKX2-5 mutations causative for congenital heart disease retain and are directed to hundreds of targets&lt;/description&gt;</code><br/> <code>&lt;inter_work_relation relationship-type=&quot;references&quot; identifier-type=&quot;Accession&quot;&gt;GSE44902&lt;/inter_work_relation&gt;</code> <br/> <code>&lt;/related_item&gt;</code> <br/><code>&lt;/program&gt;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><br/></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>In the examples above, the Dryad dataset was generated as part of the research published in an article.

Data repositories who register their content with DataCite follow the same process and apply the same metadata tags. This means that we achieve direct data interoperability with links in the reverse direction (data and software repositories to journal articles).</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<p>Another mechanism for depositing data and software citations is to insert it into the manuscript’s references. Publishers then deposit it as part of the article’s references. To do so, publishers follow the general process for depositing references.

Most do not readily suit datasets and software as the suite was originally established to match article and book references. This leaves out substantial metadata needed to identify and describe the dataset, however, if the resource does not have a DOI.\n<br/>\n<code>&lt;citation key=&quot;ref2&quot;&gt;</code>\n<br/>\n<code>&lt;doi&gt;10.5061/dryad.684v0&lt;/doi&gt;</code>\n<br/>\n<code>&lt;cYear&gt;2017&lt;/cYear&gt;</code>\n<br/>\n<code>&lt;author&gt;Morinha F, Dávila JA, Estela B, Cabral JA, Frías Ó, González JL, Travassos P, Carvalho D, Milá B, Blanco G&lt;/author&gt;</code>\n<br/>\n<code>&lt;/citation&gt;</code>\n<br/>\nWe are exploring the <a href=\"http://jats4r.org/data-citations\" target=\"_blank\">JATS4R</a> recommendations while we consider expanding the current collection. We welcome additional suggestions from the community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"precise-accessible-links\">Precise, accessible links</h2>\n<p>Crossref’s infrastructure is setup to facilitate the flow of information about scholarly works across the research network. We maintain a fair degree of flexibility both in the structure and completeness of metadata deposited. The aim, though, is to make the links rich in metadata, accurate in associating literature to corresponding resource, and available to both human and machine consumers as per Principle #5 and #7 in the <a href=\"https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles</a>.</p>\n<p>As with the other associated resources in the article nexus, we recommend depositing data/software links in the publication metadata via relationships. Publishers are free to do this <em>on top of</em> or <em>independent of</em> references. Relationship metadata offer a high degree of precision. References are a hodgepodge of various resources cited by the publication, including articles, books, media, blogs, reference materials, etc. and data citations are hard to isolate. Furthermore, the unstructured, “spaghetti string” text is difficult for systems to parse and extract specific information.</p>\n<p>With relationship metadata, data and software resources are expressly designated. We obtain a more accurate link that specifies identifier type and explicitly identifies data generated as part of the research shared in the paper or as reuse of existing data). The richer metadata contained here enables consumers to conduct powerful queries based on different attributes (identifier type, description, relationship), taking data discovery and mining to the next level.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, relationships are important for achieving full accessibility of data and software citations. Access to references is based on publisher permission so not all data citations can be shared (excluding DataCite DOIs). In contrast, all links deposited via relationships are publicly available.</p>\n<p>Publishers play an important role in supporting research validation and reproducibility. Data &amp; software citation is a basic part of of this practice, and instrumental in enabling the reuse and verification of these research outputs, tracking their impact, and creating a scholarly structure that recognizes and rewards those involved in producing them.

I suspected they all chose Orlando as it would provide the <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/punter\" target=\"_blank\">punter</a> that little bit of extra motivation to pay and register for the conference as they simultaneously plotted how they could tag-on some holiday time at Walt Disney World. I finally had to remove the filter last year when I realised that the scammers had moved on to advertising more realistically gritty cities in their calls for submissions and that meanwhile I had managed to miss all the mail informing me of the <a href=\"http://2016.alaannual.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ALA&rsquo;s summer 2016 meeting</a> held in, you guessed it&hellip; Orlando. <br> <br></p>\n<p>Clearly we need better mechanisms to flag dubious conferences. <br> <br></p>\n<p>Late last year Crossref&rsquo;s Strategic initiatives group was approached by “CounterMock,” a group of Crossref members (including major proceedings publishers like Springer Nature, Elsevier, IEEE, ACM, IET, etc) who were actively exploring the establishment of an identifier system and registry for scholarly conferences. <br> <br></p>\n<p>The long term goal of the group is to make it easier for publishers, researchers and other stakeholders to identify fraudulent and/or low-quality conferences. There has recently been a proliferation of conferences that seem to have been developed specifically to dupe international and early-career researchers into paying substantial conference and publication fees. Sometimes these conferences are intentionally named after long-standing and well-respected conferences. At worst these conferences are entirely fake - no meetings are held and no publications are issued. At best they produce subpar publications of questionable academic integrity. Members of the group are concerned that these &ldquo;mock conferences&rdquo; (Hence &ldquo;COUNTERMOCK&rdquo;) will: <br> <br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Waste researcher time.<br> <br></li>\n<li>Waste publisher time.<br> <br></li>\n<li>Undermine academic trust in conferences and conference proceedings as a trustworthy means of scholarly communication.<br> <br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The group understands that the &ldquo;evaluation of a conference quality&rdquo; and the &ldquo;unambiguous identification of conferences&rdquo; are separate concerns (as they are with publications, contributors, etc). But they also realise that it will be hard to address the quality issue without an infrastructure for unambiguously identifying conferences and providing meaningful provenance metadata about those conferences. Moreover, having unique identifiers for conference series would enable a number of other applications. Examples include conference-level metrics, better and more structured info about forthcoming conferences on a certain topic, and more visibility of conferences in research evaluation. <br> <br></p>\n<p>Springer Nature has built a <a href=\"http://lod.springer.com/data/search\" target=\"_blank\">POC prototype of a conference identifier system</a> and shown it to a number of other parties. The feedback has been that there is interest in the project, but that the consensus is that it should be managed a run by a neutral industry group. They have approached us to form a working group and explore how this project can be advanced. <br> <br></p>\n<p>This is all good. Crossref itself doesn&rsquo;t make value judgements on the quality of content registered with us. <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/dois-unambiguously-and-persistently-identify-published-trustworthy-citable-online-scholarly-literature-right/\">Crossref DOIs are not quality marks</a>. But we do believe that unambiguous identification of research artifacts is a perquisite to building effective trust and reputation tools.<br> <br></p>\n<p>It is possible that the issue of conference identifiers can be folded into <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-organization-identifier-project-a-way-forward/\">the work we are doing with DataCite and ORCID on organization identifiers</a>. For example, some have argued that organization identifiers should include identifiers for projects or other less formal and more ephemeral corporate entities that are often included in affiliation and/or bibliographic data. It is possible to make the similar arguments in the case of conferences.<br> <br></p>\n<p>On the other hand we have also been interested in the issue of &ldquo;project identifiers.&rdquo; <a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-2405\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Fenner</a> and <a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0902-4386\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Demeranville</a> have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4216323.v2\" target=\"_blank\">made a strong argument</a> that &lsquo;projects&rsquo; can be thought of as containers for collections of project outputs, project members and project funders. Again, it seems plausible that one could make the same case for conferences.<br> <br></p>\n<p>At the very least it is important to coordinate any work that is done on conference, project and organization identifiers. This why we have decided to form a joint Crossref/DataCite working group to specifically explore conference and project identifiers and determine how they relate both to each other and to our already ongoing work with ORCID on organization identifiers.\n<br> <br>\nAdditionally, it is likely that the working group will discuss and explore how conference/project identifiers might be used for increasing the transparency of peer review at conferences, better attribution for programme chairs and program committee members, and how they might be incorporated into other services like <a href=\"https://search.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref Metadata Search</a>, <a href=\"https://search.datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite search</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/\">CrossMark</a>, etc.<br> <br></p>\n<p>If you are interested in doing some work on this- then please indicate your interest in joining a working group by sending email to <code>community@crossref.org</code> and include the text <code>conference identifiers WG</code> in the subject heading.<br> <br></p>\n<p>We will update this blog as the group convenes and makes progress.<br> <br></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/florida.png\" alt= \"Florida\"/>\n</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Linking DOIs using HTTPs: the background to our new guidelines","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/linking-dois-using-https-the-background-to-our-new-guidelines/","published":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Recently we announced that we were making some new recommendations in our DOI display guidelines.

If you do </span><b>not</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> move your DOI links to HTTPS, Crossref, its members and the members of </span><a href=\"http://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other DOI registration agencies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (e.g. DataCite, JLC, CNKI)  will find it increasingly difficult to accurately measure referrals. You should link DOIs using HTTPS.</span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, if you do not support HTTPS on your site </span><b>now</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is likely that your ability to measure referrals is already impaired. If you do not already have a plan to move your site to HTTPS, you should develop one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have already transitioned your site to HTTPS, you should follow the new guidelines and link DOIs via HTTPS as soon as possible. As it stands, you are not sending any referrer information when DOIs are clicked on and followed from your site. You should also make sure that the URLs you have registered with Crossref are HTTPS URLs, otherwise <em>you</em> will not get referrer information on your site when they are followed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read on if you want some grody details. We&rsquo;ll try to keep it as non-technical as possible.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two protocols, one web</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To start with your web browser supports two closely related protocols, HTTP and HTTPS.</span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first, HTTP, is the protocol that the web started out with. It is an unencrypted protocol and it is also easy to intercept and modify. It is also very easy and inexpensive to implement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second protocol, HTTPS, is a secure version of the first protocol. It is very difficult to intercept and modify. It has historically been more complex and expensive to implement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here you might say - &ldquo;Great, but HTTPS has been around for a long time. We&rsquo;ve used it for sensitive transactions like authentication and credit card transactions. Why do we want to use DOI links with HTTPS?&rdquo; Why are you suggesting that we should even consider moving our entire site to HTTPS? </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pressure to move to HTTPS</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The insecure HTTP protocol has become a major vector for a lot of security issues on the web. It allows user web pages to be intercepted and modified between the server and the browser. This flaw is being abused for everything from spying, to inserting unwanted advertisements into web pages, to distributing viruses, ransomware and botnets. </span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As such, there has been a steady drumbeat of industry encouragement to move to the more secure HTTPS protocol for all website functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are not going to argue all the points here. Instead we will mention the major constituencies that are advocating for a move to HTTPS and provide you with some pointers. We apologise that these are all so US-centric, but a lot of the web&rsquo;s global direction does seem to be presaged by US adoption trends.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is probably easiest to start with Google, since its practices tend to focus the attention of those managing websites.</span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in 2014 </span><a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google announced that they would slowly move toward including the use of HTTPS as a ranking signal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In 2015 they upped the ante by announcing that </span><a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2015/12/indexing-https-pages-by-default.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they would start indexing HTTPS versions of pages by default</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It looks like in early 2017 they will really start to take the gloves off as they </span><a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">modify their Chrome browser to flag sites that do not use HTTPS as being <code>insecure</code></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every top website, </span><a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=evah\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evah</span></a></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It looks like Google's plan is working too. Their </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/https/grid/?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016 transparency report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows that most top websites have already transitioned to HTTPS and that this translates to approximately 25% of all web traffic worldwide taking place using HTTPS. Indeed, over 50% of all web pages viewed by desktop users are delivered via HTTPS.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government agencies</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USA’s Whitehouse issued [</span><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/06/08/https-everywhere-government\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a directive instructing all Federal websites to adopt HTTPS</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">]. As of December 2016 </span><a href=\"https://pulse.cio.gov/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">64%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of federal websites have made the transition.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libraries</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much of the pressure to move to HTTPS is coming from the library community who have a historical tradition of protecting patron privacy and resisting efforts to censor content. The third principle of the American Library Association's code of ethics reads:</span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We protect each library user&rsquo;s right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently there has been </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/librarians-act-now-protect-your-users-its-too-late\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a major push by the Electronic Frontier Foundation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get libraries to adopt a number of security and privacy practices, including the use of HTTPS by all library systems as well as those used by library vendors.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are Crossref members doing about HTTPS?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How big an issue is this? How many of our members have moved to HTTPS? How many plan to? Well, we looked at the URLs that are registered with Crossref and we tested them with both protocols. Eventually we will write a blog post detailing our findings - but the highlights are:</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slightly fewer than half of the member domains tested only support HTTP.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slightly fewer than half of the member domains tested support both HTTP and HTTPS.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 370 of the member domains tested only support HTTPS.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to HTTPS and the issue of DOI referrals</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The HTTP referrer is a piece of information passed on by a browser that indicates the site from which the user navigated.</span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, for example, if a user visiting site <code>A</code> clicks on a link which takes them to site <code>B</code>, site <code>B</code> will then record in its logs that a user visited them from site A. Obviously, this is important information for understanding where your web site traffic comes from. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The default rules for referrals are<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you link between two sites with the same level of security, all referral information is retained.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you follow a link from an insecure (HTTP) web site to a secure (HTTPS) site, referral data is passed on to the secure web site. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you follow a link from a secure (HTTPS) web site to an insecure (HTTP) site, referral data is not passed on to the insecure web site.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let's see what the situation would look like with normal links. If we had two sites, `A` &amp; `B`, the following table maps the possible combinations of protocols that can be used to link from `A` to `B`. So, for example, row #2 reads:</span>\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A user browses site A using HTTP and clicks on a HTTPS link to publisher B who hosts their site using HTTPS. </span></blockquote>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last column indicates if the referrer information is passed along by the browser. In the case of row #2, the answer is “yes”. The user has navigated from a less secure site to a more secure site.</span>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>User views site A using</b></td>\n<td><b>Site A links to site B using</b></td>\n<td><b>Browser reports referrer to site B</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\nBut this gets a little more complicated with DOIs. In this case publisher `A` links to publisher `B` through the DOI system. This means there are two parts to the link. The first `(A-&gt;doi.org)` results in a redirect (A-&gt;B). Again we use the last columns to indicate when referrer information is passed along to site B. Again, let’s look at row #2. It reads:</span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A user browses the site of member A using HTTP and clicks on a HTTP DOI link. The DOI system redirects the browser to member B using an HTTPS link registered with Crossref by member B. The middle column and the last column records whether Crossref and the publisher were able to see referrer information. The answer in both cases is “yes”. In the first case (A-&gt;DOI) because the link was from a less secure site (HTTP on A) to a more secure site (HTTPS at DOI). The second case because the link is between two sites at the same security level (HTTP).</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><b>User views site A using</b></td>\n<td><b>Site A links DOI using</b></td>\n<td><b>Browser reports referrer to Crossref<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup></b></td>\n<td><b>Crossref redirects to site B using<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup></b></td>\n<td><b>Browser reports referrer to site B</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTP</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\nSo what does this mean?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our old display guidelines recommended linking DOIs using HTTP. Rows #1, #2, #5, #6 represent the status quo.</span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About half of our members support HTTPS. A few support it exclusively and it seems, given the industry pressures mentioned above, those who support both protocols are likely doing so as a transition stage to HTTPS-only sites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that </span><b>the scenarios represented in row #5 &amp; #6 are already happening</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The referral information for any user viewing one of our member sites using HTTPS is being lost when they click on DOIs that use the HTTP protocol. Crossref doesn&rsquo;t get the referral data and neither does the member whose DOI has been clicked on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course this applies to non-member sites that link to DOIs as well. Wikipedia is the largest referrer of DOIs from outside the industry. In 2015 The Wikimedia Foundation </span><a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made a highly publicised transition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to HTTPS on all of their sites. This means that any of our members who are running HTTP sites have already lost the ability to see any referral information from Wikipedia on their own sites. However, Crossref </span><a href=\"http://blog.crossref.org/2016/05/https-and-wikipedia.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">worked closely with Wikimedia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ensure that, at the very least, Crossref was still able to record Wikimedia referral data on behalf of our members.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A solution</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is largely this work with Wikimedia that has helped us to understand just how important it is for Crossref to get ahead of the curve in helping our community to transition to HTTPS.</span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as our members are running a combination of HTTP and HTTPS sites, there is no way for our community to avoid some disruption in the flow of referral data. And we certainly would never entertain the notion of asking our members to keep using HTTP.The best we can do is recommend a practice that will help smooth the transition to HTTPS. That is what we are doing.Our new recommendation is to move to linking DOIs using HTTPS. This is represented in rows #3, #4, #7 and #8 in the table above. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a particularly important step for our members who have already moved to hosting their sites on HTTPS. As long as they are using HTTP DOIs on their site, they will be sending no referral traffic to Crossref, other Crossref members or other users of the DOI infrastructure. This is captured in scenarios #5 and #6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If our linking guidelines are followed during the industry’s transition to HTTPS, then scenario #5 and #6 will eventually be replaced with scenario #7. It is still not perfect, but at least it means that, during the transition, publishers who are still running HTTP sites will be able to get some DOI referral data via Crossref. And of course, once our members have widely transitioned to HTTPS, everything will go back to normal and they will be able to see referral data on their own sites as well (i.e.they will have moved from the state represented in row #1 to state represented in row #8.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, please change your sites to use HTTPS to link DOIs.

If you want to be able to still collect referrer information on your site (scenario #8) as opposed to via Crossref (scenario #7).</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> But can’t I avoid redepositing my URLs and get referrer data again if I simply redirect HTTP URLs to HTTPS on my own site?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> No. The browser will strip referrer information if there is any HTTP step in the redirects. Even if the redirect is done on your own site.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> Can I avoid having to redeposit all my URLs? Can’t Crossref just update the protocol on our existing DOIs for us?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> Contact </span><a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support@crossref.org</a></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We’ll see what we can do.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> What about all the old PDFs that are are there? They link to DOIs using HTTP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> That is true. But links followed from PDFs don’t send referrer information anyway.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> And what about my new PDFs? Should I start linking DOIs from them using HTTPS.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> Probably. But not because of the DOI referrer problem. Simply because HTTPS is a more secure, private, and future-proof protocol.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> Don’t some countries block HTTPS?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> Typically countries block specific sites and/or services. We do not know of any countries that have a blanket block on the HTTPS protocol.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> I use a link resolver that uses OpenURL + a  cookie pusher to redirect my users to local resources. What do I need to do?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> You need to change your cookie pusher script to enable the <code>Secure</code> attribute for cookies for HTTPS-linked DOIs.   </span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use protocol-relative URLs (e.g. </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20320\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">//doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20320</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> Protocol-relative URLs can be used in HTML HREFs to help ease the transition from HTTP to HTTPS, but use the full protocol in the text of the DOI link itself. So, for example, the following is fine:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n</span></p>\n<pre><a href=\"//doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20320\">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20320</a></pre>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> I hear that HTTP and HTTPS versions of URI identifiers are considered to be different identifiers. Doesn’t this mean that by moving to HTTPS we are essentially doubling the number of DOI-based identifiers out there?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> Yes. It isn’t a problem that is only being faced by DOIs. Basically all HTTP-URI based identifiers face the same issue. We will put in place appropriate same-as assertions in our metadata and HTTP headers to allow people to understand that the HTTP and HTTPS representations of the DOI point to the same thing. </span></p>\n<p><em>On a personal note (@gbilder speaking- don’t blame @CrossrefOrg) - it breaks my brain that the official line is that the protocol difference means they are different identifiers. As a practical matter (a concept the W3C seems to be increasingly alienated from), it would be insane for anybody to follow this policy to the letter. You can probably be pretty safe swapping the protocols on DOIs and being sure you will get the same thing.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q:</strong> I see that the Crossref site isn’t running on HTTPS. Are you just a bunch of hypocrites?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A:</strong> <del>Yes. The site will be moving to HTTPS-only very soon.

It is a higher education initiative whose mission is to maximize research impact by making research widely accessible, discoverable, and reusable. SHARE’s data set is free, openly licensed, and built with open source technology developed at the Center for Open Science (COS). Launched in beta in April 2015 the data set has grown to more than 6 million records from 100+ providers, including Crossref, Social Science Research Network (SSRN), DataONE, 50+ library institutional repositories, and more.</span></p>\n<p><span ><b>How is the Crossref REST API used within SHARE?</b></span></p>\n<p><span >SHARE currently harvests metadata from Crossref using the Crossref application programming interface (API).

The rights-declaration information is invaluable for individuals who want to know what category the object is in (public domain, copyrighted, etc.), what constraints or permission requirements exist, contact information, and more. Additionally, networks of research can be discovered and meta-scholarship facilitated by making article reference lists machine-readable and openly available. </span></p>\n<p><span ><b>What’s next?</b></span></p>\n<p><span >Does this give you any ideas?

They regularly review existing fees to discuss if any changes are needed. They also review new services while they are being developed, to assess if fees should be charged and if so, what those fees should be. For example, the committee recently made recommendations to the board about the fees for a new service called Event Data that we’ll launch soon, and the Content Registration fees for preprints - our newest content type.  In addition, the board can also ask the committee to address specific issues about policies and services.

Why? Most URLs suffer from link rot and can be created, deleted or changed at any time. And that’s a problem if you’re trying to cite them.</p>\n<p>Thus the Crossref DOI was born: an Identifier which is Persistent, which means that it’s designed to live forever (or, as Geoff Bilder rather more <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/january-2015-doi-outage-followup-report/\">prosaically puts it</a>, as long as we do), and also Resolvable, which means that you can click on it. A DOI <strong>is</strong> a URL, but it’s imbued with special properties. I say special, not magical, because all of the things that make Crossref DOIs what they are, are obtained through agreements and common standards rather than any kind of magic.</p>\n<p>As part of the development of Crossref Event Data I’ve been doing some research about the relationship between DOIs and URLs. It’s a problem we have to solve in order to make Event Data work, but it’s a much broader and more interesting story, and the results have wide applicability. I’ll be telling this story at <a href=\"http://pidapalooza.org/\">PIDapalooza</a>. If you’re interested in Persistent Identifiers you should go and <a href=\"http://pidapalooza.org/\">registration is open</a>, though hurry, as it’s next week and in Rejkjavik, Iceland!</p>\n<p>This is also a story in progress. As I write not all of the data is in, and we can be certain that it will evolve in ways we have no idea about. It’s also quite long but I’ll do my best to disqualify it from the bedtime reading list.</p>\n<h2 id=\"full-circle\">Full circle</h2>\n<p>Crossref was established just over fifteen years ago with the purpose of forming the linking hub between publishers. Our job was — and still is — to register content for publishers and then continue to work with them to ensure their DOIs always point to the right location of the content. To do this we need to do one main thing: send people in the right direction when they click on a DOI, and know which direction to point them in.</p>\n<p>Today, linking is still an important part of what Crossref does, but we do a huge amount more. One of the new things we’re working on is Crossref Event Data. It’s a service for tracking how and where people use scholarly content (such as articles) across the web and social media. Early research suggested that if we limited ourselves to just looking for DOIs we wouldn’t find much. Instead we broadened our aims a little: rather than looking for mentions of registered content exclusively via their DOIs, we look for them via the most suitable mechanism. In most cases this means the actual URL of the Item. So we have come full circle: we started linking DOIs to URLs. Now we’re trying to link URLs back to DOIs.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/10/1.png\" alt=\"urls-back-to-dois\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p>Which URL are we talking about here? The Crossref Guidelines say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DOI-routed reference links enabled by Crossref must resolve to a response page containing no less than complete bibliographic information about the target content …</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p >\n<a href=\"http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/59pub_rules.html\">http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/59pub_rules.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>This is what’s referred to as the Landing Page. Every Landing Page has a URL. Usually when you want to read information about an Article, it’s the Landing Page that you’re looking at. I should also say at this point that when I say Article I mean any item of Crossref Registered Content with a DOI. So the same applies to books, chapters, conference proceedings etc. But as most items are Articles, I’ll stick with that for now.</p>\n<p>I’m going to make some assumptions. Unfortunately, and I don’t want to spoil the surprise here, they all turn out to be false. They’re all reasonable assumptions, though, and you would be forgiven for thinking, or at least wishing, that they were true.</p>\n<p>So suspend your disbelief and follow me down the rabbit-hole…</p>\n<h2 id=\"assumption-1-a-doi-points-directly-to-a-landing-page-url\">Assumption 1: A DOI points directly to a Landing Page URL</h2>\n<p>When you click on a DOI you are taken to the Article Landing Page. It seems like a perfectly valid assumption to think that you are taken directly there.</p>\n<p>The DOI system is essentially a big lookup table. In the first column is the DOI and in the second column is the URL. Publishers request that we register each item’s DOI and supply us with the URL it should point to. We work with CNRI and the International DOI Foundation to keep the system running and it means that when you, the reader at home, click on a DOI, you end up on the article’s Landing Page.</p>\n<p>It would be very convenient if our assumption were true. If we wanted to turn a URL back into an article page, we could just swap the two columns and find the DOI by looking up the URL.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/10/2.png\" alt=\"flip DOIs\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>It turns out that it’s not quite so simple.</p>\n<p>The Landing Page is under control of the publisher, as is the URL that they supply us with. They don’t need to supply us with the final landing page URL, only with one that <em><strong>leads</strong></em> to the landing page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"http-redirects\">HTTP redirects</h2>\n<p>When you request a URL, either by typing it into your browser or by clicking on a link, your browser contacts the server and gets a reply. That reply can be “200 OK, here’s your page”, “303, look over there” or the dreaded “404, I can’t find it”. Other HTTP response codes are available, including well-known classics such as 201, 500 and 418.</p>\n<p>If it’s a 303, your browser will follow the redirect URL. The response that comes back from that redirect could be another 303. You could end up following a whole chain of redirects. You wouldn’t notice anything, except having to wait an extra few milliseconds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"extraordinary-diversity\">Extraordinary diversity</h2>\n<p>Crossref was created by a group of publishers who needed a way to link between articles. It was an ambitious goal: create a central system with which any publisher can integrate their own systems; one that allows linking to any article no matter who published it. Today we have over 5,000 members and counting, all contributing to our metadata engine. And up to 2 million DOIs are resolved every day, by all kinds of people and systems. Our wide range of members means a wide range of systems with a wide range of designs.</p>\n<p>This brings an extraordinary diversity of behavior. If we want to make observations about DOIs we can’t just take a random sample of the over 80 million. Instead, we need to take a sample of DOIs per Publisher System. Even taking a sample per publisher might not do the job because some publishers run a variety of systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"experiment-1-does-crossref-know-all-landing-pages\">Experiment 1: Does Crossref know all Landing Pages?</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Atomic_Laboratory_Experiment_on_Atomic_Materials_-_GPN-2000-000663.jpg/256px-Atomic_Laboratory_Experiment_on_Atomic_Materials_-_GPN-2000-000663.jpg\"\nalt=\"Atomic Laboratory Experiment on Atomic Materials - GPN-2000-000663\" width=\"40%\"/><figcaption>\n<h4>By NASA / Paul Riedel (Great Images in NASA: Home - info - pic) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons</h4>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Crossref knows the Landing Page URL for all DOIs.</p>\n<p>For a sample of Items, we can follow the DOI link all the way through to the Landing Page, following any redirects, then compare the final Landing Page URL to the one that Crossref knows about. If there are extra redirects, that means that the one we have on file isn’t the final one.</p>\n<p>We need to tighten up the terminology at this stage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DOI URL</strong> - The full DOI, e.g. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678</a></a> .</li>\n<li><strong>Resource URL</strong> - The URL that Crossref has on file (stored in our system). This is where the browser is initially redirected.</li>\n<li><strong>Destination URL</strong> - The URL that we end up at if we follow all the redirects.</li>\n<li><strong>Article Landing Page</strong> - The page that represents the item. If everything works, this should be the same as the Destination URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reason we’re talking about the Destination URL as distinct from the Article Landing Page when they should be the same thing will become clear later. Consider yourself foreshadowed.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/10/3-2.png\" alt=\"redirects\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>So let’s re-word our hypothesis:</p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The Destination URL is the same as the Resource URL.</p>\n<p><strong>Method:</strong> A sample of DOIs was taken (most items updated in 2016, all from 2009 or earlier). The Resource URL was obtained for all of them. The DOIs were split by the domain name of the Resource URL (to give a good coverage of all Publisher systems). A sample of Resource URLs was followed per domain, at least 200 (or fewer if that exceeds the number of DOIs available). Where there were HTTP redirects they were followed.</p>\n<p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of Items sampled Destination URL: 253,381</li>\n<li>Number where Resource URL = Destination URL: 46,995 or 19.96%</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Not all Resource URLs are the same as the Destination URL by a long shot. Crossref does not automatically know every landing page URL.</p>\n<p>Now we know the truth about our first assumption: DOIs don’t point directly to Landing Pages. If we want to reverse Landing Pages back into DOIs, we’re going to need to go a bit deeper…</p>\n<h2 id=\"interlude\">Interlude</h2>\n<p>But first, an interlude with some information about publishers, owners, and systems, because now seems like the right time to do it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assumption-2-you-can-tell-the-publisher-of-a-doi-by-looking-at-its-prefix\">Assumption 2: You can tell the publisher of a DOI by looking at its prefix</h2>\n<p>This is a real one one that people believe. Again, it’s entirely understandable. People look at a DOI like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136117.g001\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136117.g001\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136117.g001</a></a> , which takes them to PLoS and naturally assume that another DOI like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136053.t003\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136053.t003\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136053.t003</a></a> — because it has the same prefix of 10.1371 — is also for a PLoS item.</p>\n<p>Whilst this turns out to be true most of the time, it’s not true for all Items, which makes it a dangerous assumption to make.</p>\n<p>It is true that every publisher is given a prefix. They can then register DOIs with this prefix. It is also true that Items can be transferred between publishers. Because DOIs are persistent, the prefix in the DOI doesn’t change. So you might find a DOI that belongs to a publisher that has an unexpected prefix. Publishers can also be bought and sold, merged and split, which means that whilst most publishers have a single prefix, some, like Elsevier, have several. Take the case of Elsevier, who has 26 at the time of writing (you can see this in <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/v1/members/78\">Elsevier’s entry in the Crossref Metadata API</a>).</p>\n<p>Every Item has an ‘owner prefix’ in addition to the prefix in the DOI. The owner prefix is the same as the DOI prefix when the Item is created, but over time, as articles are transferred, that can change to indicate that it is owned by another publisher.</p>\n<p>Every Item has a DOI, and every DOI has a prefix. But every Item also has an Owner Prefix (you can check this in the Metadata API in the ‘prefix’ field).</p>\n<p>So Assumption 2 has been laid to rest. The only thing you can tell from looking at a DOI is that it is, in fact, a DOI (you can tell by the “10.” index code).</p>\n<p>Why do we care about identifying publishers anyway?</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-fair-test\">A Fair Test</h2>\n<p>We fundamentally want to conduct a fair test. The reason we can’t just take a random sample from the set of all DOIs is that there are lots of members who all do things slightly differently. Therefore we need to take a sample per publisher ‘system’. The word ‘system’ is a bit fuzzy, but my assumption is that two articles in the same system will behave the same way so we can treat them the same.</p>\n<p>We also know that each Crossref member may be running more than one system, or a mixture. Therefore just looking at the owner of a DOI may not give accurate results if we want to conduct a survey of all the systems out there.</p>\n<p>There’s no perfect answer, but the approach I’m taking is to look at the domain name of the Resource URL. We often find lots of subdomains for the same publisher, for example, “psw.sagepub.com”, “pol.sagepub.com”, “psx.sagepub.com” and “bpi.sagepub.com”. It’s clear that these are all operated by Sage, but they might or might not all be running on different ‘systems’.</p>\n<p>Therefore I’m splitting DOIs up into groups based on the domain of their Resource URL. It may turn out that some publishers use a single system running on many domains, or it may turn out that some publishers use a different system for each domain they use. The key point is to find a sampling technique that broadly works, and that allows us to explore and differentiate, as keenly as possible, the variety of systems and behaviours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-all-the-redirects\">Why all the redirects?</h2>\n<p>Curious minds might at this stage be wondering about all these extra redirects. Surely it’s extra stuff for the publisher to maintain. Why don’t they just point the DOI directly to the landing page?</p>\n<p>The answer must be prefaced by repeating that there is a huge number of publishers, running a variety of systems, so we’ll never be able to completely answer that. But some humble suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They might want to be able to change the URLs of the Landing Pages. It may be easier to update their internal systems than send the update to Crossref, especially in bulk.</li>\n<li>Different parts of their technology stack may be owned by different parts of the company, or outsourced. It’s easier to define internal boundaries than to co-ordinate business units and cross an external one.</li>\n<li>A publisher may run a mix of different technology. As part of their systems integration process, they set up a redirect server to make everything work together.</li>\n<li>A publisher assigns DOIs to articles but also has their own internal IDs. They maintain their own DOI-to-internal-ID lookup service.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"internal-doi-resolvers\">Internal DOI resolvers</h3>\n<p>That last point is an interesting one. The DOI system is the canonical “DOI-to-URL resolver”. That doesn’t prevent publishers from running their own. Indeed, many do.</p>\n<p>To take a real example of <a href=\"https://plos.org\">PLoS</a>, an Open Access publisher who registers lots of content with Crossref. To follow one of their DOIs we go on the following journey of redirects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164910</li>\n<li>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164910</li>\n<li>http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0164910</li>\n<li>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164910</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the last step uses a DOI, this suggests that they use the DOI as an internal identifier. All those redirects were for some purpose, but they weren’t mapping a DOI to an internal ID. This is therefore <strong>not</strong> an internal DOI resolver.</p>\n<p>Another example from JAMA Surgery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.142.7.595\" target=\"_blank\">http://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.142.7.595</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/archsurg.142.7.595\" target=\"_blank\">http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/archsurg.142.7.595</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/487551\" target=\"_blank\">http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/487551</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/487551\" target=\"_blank\">http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/487551</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this case we see a mapping from the DOI 10.1001/archsurg.142.7.595 to the ID 487551.</p>\n<p>Can we define a heuristic for this pattern? Yes, but not a perfect one.

Now that we’ve got a little insight into the reasons that publishers might run their own DOI resolvers, we can resume our journey of assumptions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assumption-3-we-can-find-the-landing-page-for-every-doi\">Assumption 3: We can find the Landing Page for Every DOI</h2>\n<p>Now we know that we can’t just use the lookup table in reverse, but have to follow the links all the way to their destination. Does this approach actually work?</p>\n<p>This is a pretty big question and we need to be clear about what we mean by ‘every’ DOI. The set of DOIs I’m using (although I’m using a subset) is “all DOIs in our Metadata API that are found in doi.org”.</p>\n<p>What is a DOI? Geoff Bilder went over it in the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/doi-like-strings-and-fake-dois/\">DOI-like-strings blog post</a> earlier this year. The definition I’m working to here is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A DOI is an identifier for an item of content registered in the DOI system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, if you resolve the DOI on <a href=\"https://doi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/</a> and it’s recognised, that counts as a DOI. I’m working from the set of DOIs found in the Crossref system as I’m primarily concerned with Crossref DOIs. However, we collaborate closely with DataCite.</p>\n<p>Back to our assumption: “we can find the Landing Page for every DOI”. The answer is that we can, most of the time. But because Crossref Event Data has to work as well as possible, and therefore work with as many DOIs as possible, we have to scour all the nooks and crannies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"assumption-4-every-doi-points-somewhere-unique\">Assumption 4: Every DOI points somewhere unique</h3>\n<p>Stop me when you find the deliberate mistake:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Every Item corresponds to a different thing</li>\n<li>Every Item has a single DOI</li>\n<li>Every DOI is different</li>\n<li>Every DOI points to a landing page</li>\n<li>Therefore every DOI points to a different landing page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Two things immediately suggest themselves:</p>\n<p><em>“Every item has a single DOI”</em> should be true, but it isn’t. We find that sometimes two DOIs are assigned to the same item. This can happen when publications change hands between publishers, or when mistakes are made, or for a variety of other reasons. We also find that in some cases Publishers registered a DOI for the metadata and one for the article abstract. The two DOIs point to the same place. In some cases where there were two DOIs registered for the same thing we create an Alias.</p>\n<p>When we alias a DOI we simply say “this DOI should actually point to this one”. Both DOIs still exist, and both still point to the ‘correct’ thing, it’s just that they both point to the same place. If we have two DOIs pointing to the same place, then there isn’t a one-to-one mapping, and Assumption 4 is incorrect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"experiment-4-aliased-dois\">Experiment 4: Aliased DOIs</h2>\n<p><a title=\"By The Air Force Research Laboratory’s Directed Energy Directorate [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ALasertests.jpg\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Lasertests.jpg/256px-Lasertests.jpg\" alt=\"Lasertests\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> There isn’t a one-to-one mapping between DOIs and URLs because some DOIs are aliased to others.</p>\n<p><strong>Method:</strong> We collected a sample of Resource URLs from the DOI API.

We counted how many DOIs have Resource URLs that aren’t unique. We subtract the number of deleted DOIs because all deleted DOIs have the same resource URL.</p>\n<p><strong>Observations</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From a sample size of 11,227,458</li>\n<li>a total of 112,195 have duplicate resource URLs, or 0.99%</li>\n<li>of these duplicates, 77,896 have the ‘deleted’ URL</li>\n<li>leaving 34,229, or 0.30% having non-unique Resource URLs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A small number of DOIs have duplicate Resource URLs, even if we exclude those that have been deleted, which means that not every DOI can have a unique URL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assumption-5-the-landing-page-is-the-same-as-the-destination-page\">Assumption 5: The Landing Page is the same as the Destination Page.</h2>\n<p>HTTP has a very neat system for doing redirects. If it were that simple, then we could easily look up every Destination page and confidently say that it was the Landing Page. Not so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cookies\">Cookies</h2>\n<p>Web browsers aren’t the only tools that use HTTP. Most programming languages have HTTP capabilities built in.</p>\n<p>Using cookies is a requirement of some websites, but it’s not a requirement of HTTP. Most websites use cookies in some way or another. When you log into a site, you expect cookies. But when you’re just browsing there isn’t any technical need. A small number of websites absolutely require cookies to be enabled to use the site, even if you’re just browsing and not logged in. Unfortunately, this includes some publishers.</p>\n<p>Requiring cookies to use a publisher site means that you can’t fully resolve a DOI without enabling cookies. Most tools out there don’t. Some privacy-conscious people quite reasonably don’t enable cookies from all sites.</p>\n<p>Using cookies when resolving a DOI adds considerable overhead and isn’t fool-proof.</p>\n<p>Let’s try a quick experiment to see when we land up on a cookie page. Here’s an example page that tells us that we should have enabled cookies: <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/action/cookieAbsent\"><a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/action/cookieAbsent\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tandfonline.com/action/cookieAbsent</a></a> . It’s reachable from the DOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envhaz.2007.09.007\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envhaz.2007.09.007\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envhaz.2007.09.007</a></a> .</p>\n<h2 id=\"experiment-6-some-dois-cant-be-resolved-without-cookies\">Experiment 6: Some DOIs can’t be resolved without cookies</h2>\n<p><a title=\"By National Eye Institute (Laboratory Experiment) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ALaboratory_scientist_conducts_an_experiment_with_a_Rotary_evaporator.jpg\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Laboratory_scientist_conducts_an_experiment_with_a_Rotary_evaporator.jpg/512px-Laboratory_scientist_conducts_an_experiment_with_a_Rotary_evaporator.jpg\" alt=\"Laboratory scientist conducts an experiment with a Rotary evaporator\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: We can’t resolve some DOIs to the Landing Page using standard tools because cookies are required.</p>\n<p><strong>Method</strong>: A sample of DOIs was taken per Resource URL Domain. They were resolved by following HTTP links. Where the Destination URL contains the word ‘cookie’, we mark that as a DOI requiring a cookie.</p>\n<p><strong>Observations</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A sample of 253,381 DOIs were resolved following HTTP redirects where necessary</li>\n<li>a total of 6305 resolved to a page with ‘cookie’ in the URL or 2.48%</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>There are cookies at play for at least 2.48% of DOIs. This is probably a very conservative estimate, as we’re using a blunt tool looking for ‘cookie’ in the URL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cookies-required\">Cookies Required</h2>\n<p>For one DOI I found, the publisher system set cookies, then sent us on a series of redirects which set cookies that expired in the past and then, as far as I can tell, checked whether or not they were sent back. My working hypothesis is that it was profiling the behaviour to see what browser I was using.</p>\n<p>I have also seen javascript-based redirects. This is where a web page loads a javascript file, which executes and sends the browser onto another URL. This seems to be to be a browser detection method. There is no way you can follow these DOIs without actually using a real browser.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for Crossref Event Data. We can’t fire up a browser and follow every DOI: it isn’t practical. When I tried this for a sample as an experiment I got an email from another publisher who was worried that we were scraping data (good bot operators always put contact details in their request headers!).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/59pub_rules.html\">Crossref member rules</a> leave some wiggle-room about whether this is allowed, but for the Event Data service, we can say that it’s a physical impossibility to collect all Event Data for DOIs like this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bring-in-the-browser\">Bring in the Browser</h2>\n<p>To quantify the size of the problem, we need to bring in a web browser. If we assume that some Publishers design their sites to work only with real browsers, that’s what we’ll use. Luckily there are web browsers packaged up into an automatable package, and we can use these to visit the DOI.</p>\n<p>Using one of these is considerably slower than just following link headers.</p>\n<p>I have split the ‘destination’ concept into two:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Naïve destination URL: The URL that you get from following HTTP redirects acccording to the HTTP specification</li>\n<li>Browser destination URL: The URL that you get from letting a browser follow the DOI doing whatever a browser does.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rather than defining a complicated spectrum of types of DOI resolution behaviour, I am classifying DOIs into two groups: those where standard HTTP redirects are sufficient and everything else.</p>\n<p>The method I am using is to resolve a sample of URLs using the browser. I can then compare the Naïve Destination URL with the Browser Destination URL. If they are the same, then I didn’t need to use the browser after all. If they give a different result however, I trust the Browser one better and declare that DOI to require a browser to resolve.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/10/4.png\" alt=\"naive vs browser\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>Again, I took a sample of DOIs per Resource URL domain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"experiment-7-quantify-proportion-of-dois-that-require-a-browser-to-redirect\">Experiment 7: Quantify proportion of DOIs that require a browser to redirect</h2>\n<p><a title=\"By NASA / Paul Riedel (Great Images in NASA: Home - info - pic) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AAtomic_Laboratory_Experiment_on_Atomic_Materials_-_GPN-2000-000663.jpg\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Atomic_Laboratory_Experiment_on_Atomic_Materials_-_GPN-2000-000663.jpg/256px-Atomic_Laboratory_Experiment_on_Atomic_Materials_-_GPN-2000-000663.jpg\" alt=\"Atomic Laboratory Experiment on Atomic Materials - GPN-2000-000663\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: A number of DOIs can’t be resolved with standard tools but instead require a browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Method</strong>: A sample of DOIs was selected per Resource URL domain. The links were followed using standard HTTP and using a browser. Where the URLs between the two were different, the DOI was counted as requiring a browser to resolve.</p>\n<p><strong>Observations</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A total of 59,453 items were followed both using the Naïve and Browser methods.</li>\n<li>Of these 5,883 items have a different URL between the two methods, or 9.88%</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We can’t rely on the Naïve redirect, and would have to fire up the browser in about 10% of cases in the sample.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-gnarly-things\">Other gnarly things</h2>\n<p>There are one or two supplementary gnarly things that crop up.</p>\n<p>First, session IDs are sometimes embedded in the URL. This is a tracking technique similar to cookies, but instead of sending cookies, which are invisible to the user, a unique code is placed on the end of the URL. This means that everyone gets a different URL. The most popular of these is the JSESSIONID, which is used by servers in the Java ecosystem. An example URL is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/047084289X.rn00615.pub3/abstract;jsessionid=0D1B7AC4689A494E0EA78BD2F0A710C4.f04t04\" target=\"_blank\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/047084289X.rn00615.pub3/abstract;jsessionid=0D1B7AC4689A494E0EA78BD2F0A710C4.f04t04</a></p>\n<p>We can easily remove these if they appear at the end of a URL. Sometimes they occur in the middle of a URL, as above. Sometimes they appear as query parameters:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jpharmsci.org/action/consumeSharedSessionAction?SERVER=WZ6myaEXBLGvmNGtLlDx7g%3D%3D&amp;MAID=npYBLvZTaUI3JTHw%2BH63WQ%3D%3D&amp;JSESSIONID=aaajjhdDL5ssK6d1HHrFv&amp;ORIGIN=207988872&amp;RD=RD\" target=\"_blank\">http://jpharmsci.org/action/consumeSharedSessionAction?SERVER=WZ6myaEXBLGvmNGtLlDx7g%3D%3D&amp;MAID=npYBLvZTaUI3JTHw%2BH63WQ%3D%3D&amp;JSESSIONID=aaajjhdDL5ssK6d1HHrFv&amp;ORIGIN=207988872&amp;RD=RD</a></p>\n<p>In this case we make no attempt to remove them. These URLs won’t be any use for matching, and we have to acknowledge that and move on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interpreting-the-results\">Interpreting the results</h2>\n<p>All the above experiments involved taking as many DOIs as we had time for, gathering the Resource URLs, and then grouping the DOIs per Resource URL Domain. A sample of DOIs was investigated per each Resource URL domain to give the best chance at even coverage. The above figures have been presented as a proportion of the sampled data-set.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time to draw some practical conclusions. I grouped the results per Resource URL Domain, so I can say that “for this domain, X% of DOIs was deleted, or aliased, or whatever”. This means that we can look at the statistics for a given domain and work out the best method for working with DOIs that belong to it.</p>\n<p>I have created histograms of domains by their various proportions.</p>\n<p>Our first chart is histogram of Resource URL Domains where the Naïve Destination = the Resource URL. Each domain is given a proportion which represents how many DOIs sampled on that domain have a Landing Page equal to the Resource URL.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/10/h_proportion_resource_equals_naive_destination_url.png\" alt=\"h_proportion_resource_equals_naive_destination_url\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>There’s a clear bimodal distribution here. The conclusion here is “<strong>most domains require you to follow the link to find the destination URL</strong>“. Furthermore, the domains are consistent: there are virtually no domains that have a mix of DOIs that behave differently.</p>\n<p>Our second chart is a histogram of Resource URLs where the Browser-based redirect = the Naive URL. Each domain is given a proportion which represents how many DOIs sampled on that domain require us to fire up a browser.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/10/h_proportion_naive_equals_browser_destination_url.png\" alt=\"h_proportion_naive_equals_browser_destination_url\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>Overwhelmingly, the Browser Redirect URL is the same as the Naïve Redirect URL, meaning that we don’t need to fire up the browser, we can just use the Naïve URL, which is much easier to compute. There are some resource URL domains which require every DOI to be followed in a browser rather than just following links.</p>\n<p>We know from this that we don’t have to use the browser most of the time. There is a small number of domains where we’re unsure (under 500) and a small number of domains where we know that we have to use a browser. This means we can focus our efforts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"there-are-lots-of-dois-and-they-all-behave-differently\">There are lots of DOIs and they all behave differently.</h3>\n<p>There are thousands of publishers out there registering DOIs. There are thousands of domains. Some publishers have lots of domains. This makes it impossible to make many general observations about DOIs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-cant-tell-anything-by-looking-at-the-doi\">You can’t tell anything by looking at the DOI</h3>\n<p>Just by looking at the DOI you can’t tell who published it, or which publisher’s system is hosting it. Therefore you can’t tell how it’s going to behave.</p>\n<p>We’ve looked at five kinds of URLs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The DOI itself</li>\n<li>The Resource URL</li>\n<li>The “naïve” redirect URL</li>\n<li>The “browser” redirect URL</li>\n<li>The Article Landing Page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In some cases, the Resource URL, naïve redirect URL, browser redirect and Article Landing Page are the same. In some cases they aren’t. Of these, the fifth is somewhat mythical.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dois-fall-into-classifications\">DOIs fall into classifications</h3>\n<p>Each DOI falls into a category, most preferable first:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Resource URL is the same as the Landing Page.</li>\n<li>The Landing Page can be discovered by following HTTP redirects.</li>\n<li>The Landing Page can be discovered by firing up a web browser to follow redirects.</li>\n<li>The Landing Page can’t be determined.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"we-can-predictively-group-dois\">We can predictively group DOIs</h3>\n<p>We can group DOIs by their Resource URLs and take a sample per Resource URL Domain. If all samples for a domain behave a certain way, we can place the DOIs into one of the above four groups with a probability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"well-never-know-the-full-story\">We’ll never know the full story.</h3>\n<p>Because of the diversity of Publisher Systems and the long history of Crossref DOIs, we’ll never be able to describe exactly what’s going on for all DOIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h2>\n<p>We’re continuing to develop Crossref Event Data. The part of the system that handles turning URLs back into DOIs will never be perfect, but we know from this research that we can at least work with a subset.</p>\n<p>I’m also working on another project which will attempt to reverse a Landing Page URL back into a DOI by looking at the metadata on the Landing Page. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/Crossref/doi-destinations\">read about it here</a>. Ultimately we’re going to have to take a blended approach. Building a useful set of Landing Page URL to DOI mappings will be part of the mix.</p>\n<p>As Event Data matures we’ll be sharing all the datasets automatically as part of our infrastructure, including our DOI-to-URL mapping.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And any members reading, please make your DOIs as easy to follow as possible! Please don’t require JavaScript or cookies when resolving DOIs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you’re read this far, perhaps you’re as interested in DOIs as we are. There’s a lot more to say on the subject, but that’s enough for now.

To move The OI Project forward, we will be forming a Community Working Group with the goal of holding an initial meeting before the end of 2016. The Working Group’s main charge is to develop a plan to launch and sustain an open, independent, non-profit organization identifier registry to facilitate the disambiguation of researcher affiliations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crossref-use-casesspan\">Crossref Use Cases</span></h3>\n<p>Crossref has also been discussing the needs of its members over the last year and there is value in focusing on the affiliation name ambiguity problem with research outputs and contributors. In terms of the metadata that Crossref collects, something that is missing has been affiliations for the authors of publications. Over the last couple of years, Crossref has been expanding what it collects - for example, funding and licensing data and ORCID iDs - and this enables a fuller picture of what we are calling the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-article-nexus-linking-publications-to-associated-research-outputs\">article nexus</a>. In order to continue to fill out the metadata we collect - and for our members to use in their own systems and publications - we need an organization identifier.</p>\n<p>Another use case for Crossref is identifying funders as part of collecting funder data to enable connecting funding sources with the published scholarly literature. In order to enable the reliable identification of funders in the Crossref system we created the Open Funder Registry that now has over 15,000 funders available as Open Data under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0 waiver</a>. While this has been very successful, it is a very narrowly focused registry and is not suitable for a broad, community-run organization identifier registry that addresses the affiliation use case. In future, our goal will be to merge the Open Funder Registry into the identifier registry that the Organization Identifier Working Group will work on.</p>\n<p>By working collaboratively we can define a pragmatic and cost-effective service that will meet a fundamental need of all scholarly communication stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Geoffrey Bilder will be focusing <a href=\"https://crossreflive16.sched.com/event/8hqy/geoffrey-bilder-the-case-of-the-missing-leg\">his talk at Crossref LIVE16</a> this week on this initiative, dubbed The OI Project.

But first: i</span><span ><span >n April we renamed the service from CrossCheck to Similarity Check and we now have a new service logo available to reference via our </span><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/brand\"><span >logo CDN</span></a><span > using the following code.</span></span></p>\n<p><code>&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.crossref.org/logo/crossref-similarity-check-logo-200.svg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;98&quot; alt=&quot;Crossref Similarity Check logo&quot;&gt;</code></p>\n<p><span >Earlier this year Crossref also signed a new contract with Turnitin. As part of this, we negotiated the inclusion of dedicated development time each year from Turnitin’s engineering and product teams to focus on developments in the iThenticate tool that will specifically support Similarity Check users and their needs.  Many of our members will have been contacted recently by Turnitin and asked to complete a survey regarding how they use the tool and what improvements they would like to see made in the future. The results of this survey are currently being analyzed and will be used by Turnitin to inform a development plan.</span></p>\n<p><span >Finally, throughout 2016 we have also been working with Turnitin to help them develop a new Content Intake System that provides a faster, more reliable and robust method for collecting data from Crossref and indexing users’ content into the Similarity Check full-text database.  Previously Turnitin was only able to collect prefix data from Crossref’s system on a monthly basis whereas today, with the new Content Intake System up and running, they are able to pull full-text content links from deposited metadata on a daily basis. This means that if you are a Similarity Check user currently depositing full-text URLs with Crossref, your content is being indexed by Turnitin faster than ever before.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >There are plenty of other benefits this new method provides. This is why we have agreed with Turnitin that from 1st January 2017 onwards, indexing via full-text URLs will be the only method supported for Similarity Check.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >Not convinced? Let me share my top four reasons for advocating Turnitin’s exclusive use of the full-text URL indexing method for Similarity Check:</span></p>\n<p >\n<span ><b>1. Reduced traffic to publisher servers.</b><span > Indexing via full-text URLs means that the crawl is targeted specifically to the location of the full-text PDF or HTML content, thereby reducing the amount of traffic Turnitin puts through publisher’s servers.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p >\n<span ><b>2. Lower margin for error and simplified issue recovery.</b><span > Turnitin will no longer need to make multiple fetches for any content item, meaning there are now fewer steps in the process. This means there will be fewer places for indexing errors to occur and also reduces the reliance on users setting meta tags or span tags correctly in their markup. Furthermore, if problems do arise, using the one method of indexing for all users will mean that Turnitin is able to pinpoint the issue faster and work with members to resolve it quickly. </span></span>\n</p>\n<p >\n<span ><b>3. Quicker turnaround on indexing with fewer delays.</b><span > Turnitin will no longer need to investigate and set up bespoke indexing methods for different Similarity Check users and they will be able to access the location of full-text content from the one place (ie. within the specific <iparadigms> resource tag in member’s metadata deposits). More accurate data from only one location will result in a quicker turnaround on indexing, meaning newly published content will be added into the Similarity Check content database sooner for all members to check other new manuscripts against.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p >\n<span ><b>4. Daily ingest is better than monthly!</b> Full-text links can be collected daily from Crossref-rather than monthly for other methods-meaning a more regular ingest of content.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span >The presence of full-text URLs within the metadata is critical to the functioning of Turnitin’s new indexing system. All new Similarly Check participants are now asked to ensure they have these links in place within their deposited metadata before they participate in the service.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-already-a-userof-similarity-checkspan\"><span >Already a user of Similarity Check? </span></h2>\n<p><span ><span >If you’re an existing Similarity Check participant who joined the service before 2016, your content is likely to be currently indexed via different methods, such as following links contained in your page meta tags. If you’re not currently depositing full-text links with Crossref for Similarity Check, you will have received an email from us about this in August. If you’re unsure though, you can check your XML to see if you have included the full-text link in the <iparadigms> field or you can send us an email at </span><a href=\"mailto:similaritycheck@crossref.org\"><span ><a href=\"mailto:similaritycheck@crossref.org\">similaritycheck@crossref.org</a></span></a><span > as we’d be happy to check for you. </span></span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-help-dont-leave-me-behindspan\"><span >Help, don’t leave me behind!</span></h3>\n<p><span ><span >Us? Never! We’re here to help.

These URLs should be included as part of all standard metadata deposits going forward and can be easily added into existing files in bulk. So there’s no need to redeposit the full metadata, unless of course you would prefer to do so!</span></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-thats-a-wrapspan\"><span >That’s a wrap</span></h2>\n<p><span >Looking back, it really has been a busy year for Similarity Check and it will continue to be so as we persevere in laying the groundwork for a more streamlined, robust and scalable service for 2017 and beyond. Remember, we need Similarity Check users to ensure they have full-text URLs in at least 90% of their journal article metadata by 31st December 2016 in order to continue using Similarity Check from 2017 onwards.</span></p>\n<p><span ><span >And please keep us updated!  With over 1,200 publishers using Similarity Check, we’ll need a little nudge to know when metadata has been updated to include these links.

I expect you had to carefully highlight the “10.1063/1.3599050” and then do “edit”, “copy”.  That wasn’t too bad but the next step is to put the DOI into an email and send it to someone.  But wait - what are they going to do with “10.1063/1.3599050”?  It’s useless.  If you want it to be useful you’ll have to add “</span><a href=\"http://doi.org\"><span ><a href=\"http://doi.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://doi.org</a></span></a><span >” or </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/\"><span ><a href=\"https://doi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/</a></span></a><span > in the front. </span></span></p>\n<p><span ><span >When publishers follow the guidelines it makes things easier - if you go to </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3599050\"><span ><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3599050\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3599050</a></span></a><span > you’ll note that you can just right click on the full DOI link on the page and get a full menu of options of what to do with it.  One of which is to copy the link and then you can easily paste into an email or anywhere else.</span></span></p>\n<p><span >However-putting a positive spin on the spotty adherence to the 2011 update to the DOI display guidelines-everyone has another chance with the latest set of updates to make all the changes at once! </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-more-on-https-future-proofing-scholarly-linkingspan\"><span >More on HTTPS (future-proofing scholarly linking)</span></h3>\n<p><span >We take providing the central linking infrastructure for scholarly publishing seriously.  Because we form the link between publisher sites all over the web, it’s important that we do our bit to enable secure browsing from start to finish.  In addition, HTTPS is now a ranking signal for Google <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\">who gives sites using HTTPS a small ranking boost</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span >The process of enabling HTTPS on publisher sites will be a long one and, given the number of members we have, it may a while before everyone’s made the transition.  But by using HTTPS we are future-proofing scholarly linking on the web.</span></p>\n<p><span >Some years ago we started the process of making our new services available exclusively over HTTPS.  The Crossref Metadata API is HTTPS enabled, and Crossmark and our Assets CDN use HTTPS exclusively. Last year we collaborated with Wikipedia to make all of their DOI links HTTPS.  We hope that we’ll start to see more of the scholarly publishing industry doing the same.</span></p>\n<p><span >So-it’s simple-always make the DOI a full link - <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1995.0238\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1995.0238\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1995.0238</a></a> - even when it’s on the abstract or full text page of the content that the DOI identifies - and use “<a href=\"https://doi.org/\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/</a></a>”. </span></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"The membership boom & why metadata isn’t like beer","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-membership-boom-why-metadata-isnt-like-beer/","published":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000","description":"You might recognize my name if you’ve ever applied for Crossref membership on behalf of your organization.

It recently occurred to me that, since I’ve been working in our membership department for eight years, I’ve been a part of shepherding new members for half of our history. And my, how we’ve grown. </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-bmembership-growth-by-countrybspan\"><span ><b>Membership growth by country</b></span></h3>\n<p><span >Though it may be easy to see our membership growth by looking at the numbers, I think it’s interesting to consider where we’ve grown.  The top ten member countries have dramatically changed since Crossref began sixteen years ago.  At the end of our first year of operations, our membership included 54 publishers and affiliated organizations.  The majority were from the US and the UK, with a small number from Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan. </span></p>\n<p><span >In 2012, participation in our sponsors program began to increase. Sponsors are affiliated organizations that act on behalf of smaller publishers and societies who wish to register their content with Crossref.  Several organizations from Turkey and South Korea were among the first sponsors to join and were very successful in representing a large number of publishers and societies from their regions. Soon to follow were sponsors from India, Ukraine, Russia and Brazil. In 2014, the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) became a sponsoring affiliate, focusing on smaller publishers with the aim of increasing the quality and global reach of scholarly publishing.  With the introduction of our sponsor program, the past few years have seen a steady increase in the geographical diversity of our members.  </span></p>\n<p><span ><span >There are </span><a href=\"http://www.worldatlas.com/nations.htm\"><span >194 countries</span></a><span > in the world.  It’s pretty amazing that organizations in 112 of the world’s countries are now represented in our membership. Do I think we’ll see members joining from the other 82 nations? I don’t know but I hope so.</span></span></p>\n<p><span >A look at our trending nations chart shows the diversity of our membership as we’ve grown, depicting the countries that produced the most new members over the last two years.  There has been tremendous growth from South Korea! What I find just as interesting is that we have new members from so many different nations that they form their own special bloc, shown here as “Other.” </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/blog_membergrowth.jpg\" alt=\"Membership growth\"></p>\n<p><span >Our growth has taken place at a remarkable rate.  When I joined Crossref in 2008, we had over 1800 publishers and affiliates and we were adding about 300 new members per year.  In 2015, nearly 1500 members joined and we are seeing even larger numbers so far in 2016.  Counting all publishers, affiliates, libraries, sponsors and represented members, our new member total through the end of August is nearly 1200 and will most certainly overtake the 2015 figure.  </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/blog_membersbyyear.png\" alt=\"Members by year\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-member-perceptionsspan\"><strong><span >Member perceptions</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span >With such a range of new members each month it’s even more important that we help people understand the benefits of joining Crossref.  That it’s not just registering metadata and DOIs but maintaining and improving records over time, and participating in reference linking.  We are adding and improving some educational tools that will help everyone understand how our services can enhance the discoverability of content, and why sharing richer metadata supports their full participation in the scholarly community.  We are in the process of developing a new, cleaner website with videos that better explain our services-to be released in the next few weeks,-a new onboarding experience, and new and improved query and deposit tools. </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-bconnected-metadata-isnt-like-beerbspan\"><span ><b>Connected metadata isn’t like beer </b></span></h3>\n<p><span >Sometimes inviting more people to a party means there is less beer to go around.  Fortunately for everyone, metadata isn’t like beer. In fact, the more metadata you draw from the tap, the more useful it becomes.  So inviting new members to join Crossref makes our community better and more valuable for everyone.  Every member uses that metadata to link their content to every other member’s content.  This makes all members’ content easier to find, link, and cite, not just at the moment it is published, but over time.   </span></p>\n<p><span ><span >Members from around the globe join Crossref everyday and help guide our growing community.  If you are interested in joining please contact me at </span><a href=\"mailto:member@crossref.org\"><span ><a href=\"mailto:member@crossref.org\">member@crossref.org</a></span></a><span >.</span></span></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Crossmark 2.0 - grab the code and you’re ready to go!","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossmark-2.0-grab-the-code-and-youre-ready-to-go/","published":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000","description":"On September 1st we completed the final stage of the Crossmark v2.0 release and sent an email to all participating publishers containing instructions for upgrading.

Alexander Naydenov, PaperHive’s Co-founder gives us an update on how they’re working with the Crossref metadata: </span></p>\n<p><span ><b>PaperHive</b></span></p>\n<p><span >PaperHive is a web-platform for collaborative reading and a cross­-publisher layer of   interaction on top of research documents. It lets researchers communicate in published documents in a productive and time-saving way. PaperHive thus puts academic literature, which is integrated with the platform, in the limelight and increases content usage and reader engagement.</span></p>\n<p><span ><a href=\"https://paperhive.org/\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2051 alignright\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/09/Logo-PaperHive-300x59.png\" alt=\"Logo PaperHive\" width=\"300\" height=\"59\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/09/Logo-PaperHive-300x59.png 300w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/09/Logo-PaperHive-768x151.png 768w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/09/Logo-PaperHive.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px\" /></a>Transforming reading into a process of collaboration gives researchers a reason to return to the content and discover new enrichments they can benefit from. Functionality like hiving, deep linking, and the PaperHive browser extension embeds communication in the researcher’s workflow. PaperHive is free to use!</span></p>\n<p><span ><b>How is the Crossref API used within PaperHive?</b></span></p>\n<p><span >PaperHive extends the concept of a living document and offers an innovative way of displaying content without hosting it. Instead, academic documents are dynamically pulled from the publisher’s servers thus ensuring compliance with content licensing. It enables readers to stay in touch with the articles of interest beyond just saving them in an offline folder.</span></p>\n<p><span >Crossref is the common ground on which third party companies and initiatives can build valuable services for publishers and researchers. It facilitates the integration of content into PaperHive by providing the metadata of articles and books from numerous publishers independent of the technology behind their content platforms. Moreover, if the publishers provide ORCID identifiers of authors in the Crossref metadata, researchers can immediately interact with the readers of their works.</span></p>\n<p><span ><b>What are the future plans for PaperHive?</b></span></p>\n<p><span >In addition to integrating further publishers’ content and extending PaperHive’s feature set for readers, we also plan to extend our partnerships with other technology providers.</span></p>\n<p><span >As far as our cooperation with Crossref is concerned, we are looking forward to the implementation of the</span> <a href=\"http://eventdata.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span >Crossref Event Data API</span></a><span >.</span></p>\n<p><span ><b>What else would you like to see in Crossref metadata?</b></span></p>\n<p><span >-</span> <span >      </span><span >The quality of the existing metadata should be improved significantly. We noticed that important fields such as author or title are missing in the metadata of many documents. PaperHive ignores articles and books with incomplete metadata because it impairs the user experience. Publishers, authors and readers can only benefit from the wider and more active usage of content, so we hope that more publishers will improve the data their provide Crossref with.</span></p>\n<p><span >-</span> <span >      </span><span >Since researchers are working with full texts on PaperHive, it would be great if  links to the full text are provided in the metadata of all articles and books. The metadata should also contain information about the format of the full text (e.g., PDF, EPUB, HTML).</span></p>\n<p><span ><b>Thanks Alex!</b></span></p>\n<p><span ><b>Just getting started with the API or what to know more?

This is the most efficient and effective way to ensure that data citations are fully integrated into the scholarly research information network with full and accurate metadata.</span></p>\n<p><span >All data &amp; software citations that include datasets bearing a DataCite DOI are eligible for auto-update linking with Crossref. In this method: authors cite the dataset or software containing the DataCite DOI per journal article submission guidelines and add it to the article citation list (c.f. </span><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20171019061351/https://force11.org/node/4771\" target=\"_blank\"><span >FORCE11 citation placement</span></a><span >, </span><a href=\"https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles\" target=\"_blank\"><span >FORCE11 Software Citation Principles</span></a><span >). Publishers then deposit references as part of their standard practice when registering content. Crossref checks every reference deposited for a DOI. If the DOI is identified as DataCite’s, we automatically link it to the article. </span><strong>With this method, no additional action is needed when publishers register their content with Crossref.</strong></p>\n<p>Data citation links to non-DataCite DOIs can only be exposed in the references if the publisher makes references openly available. Even in the event that the data citation is shared, it remains undifferentiated from other references. Method B described below offers another approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"method-b-relation-type\">Method B: Relation type</h3>\n<p><span >Publishers can link their publication to a variety of associated research objects as part of the article metadata directly in the metadata deposited to Crossref, including data &amp; software, protocols, videos, published peer reviews, preprints, conference papers, etc. Doing so not only groups digital objects together, but formally associates them with the publication.

It also supports associated research objects regardless of identifier type. When an associated entity has a DOI, however, we can validate the relationship during metadata processing as well as provide a more reliable representation of the article nexus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"article-nexus-a-far-richer-scholarly-map\">Article nexus: a far richer scholarly map</h3>\n<p><span >Bibliographic metadata is like a ship’s manifest that catalogs each item of cargo in a ship’s hold - crate, drum, sack, and barrel. It identifies the components that have an internal relation to the publication (contributor, funder, article update, license, etc.), each of which are well-understood points on the scholarly map. But when we integrate the article nexus into the graph, new territories become visible - not isolated islands, but places with highways connecting them to addresses already known.</span></p>\n<p><span >When a publication has its relationships clearly identified, the connections both go out as well as lead back to it.

It is a collaboration platform to write, share and openly research </span><span >in real-time: write manuscripts and include rich media, such as data sets, software, source code and videos. The media-rich, data-driven capabilities of Authorea make it the perfect platform to create and disseminate a new generation of research articles, which are natively web-based, open, and reproducible. Authorea is free to use.</span></span></p>\n<p><span ><b>How is the Crossref Metadata API used within Authorea?</b></span></p>\n<p><span >Authorea is specifically made for scholarly documents such as research articles, conference papers, grey literature, class notes, student papers, and problem sets. What makes scholarly documents so peculiar are their citations and references, mathematical notation, tables, and data. For citations and references, we built a citation tool which allows authors to search and cite scholarly papers with ease, without having to leave the editor. While in the middle of writing a sentence, authors can click the “cite” button and a citation tool opens up:</span></p>\n<p><span ><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/Authorea-screenshot.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1715 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/Authorea-screenshot-241x300.jpg\" alt=\"Authorea screenshot\" width=\"241\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/Authorea-screenshot-241x300.jpg 241w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/Authorea-screenshot.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 85vw, 241px\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span >We currently use two engines for searching scholarly literature via their APIs: Crossref and Pubmed.

It doesn’t store data for all DOIs (it includes only those that are used on average once a day), but it has information on up to 1 million DOIs per month over about 5 years, and about 500 million data points in total.</span></p>\n<p><span >Storing 500 million data points is within the capabilities of a well-configured database. In the first iteration of Chronograph a MySQL database was used. But that kind of data starts to get tricky to back up, move around and index.</span></p>\n<p><span >Every month or two new data comes in for processing, and it needs to be uploaded and merged into the database. Indexes need to be updated.

There are various solutions for storing this kind of data, including Cassandra, time-series databases and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span >The flip side of being able to do interesting experiments is wanting them to stick around without having to bother a sysadmin. The data is important to us, but we’d rather not have to worry about running another server and database if possible.</span></p>\n<p><span >Chronograph fits into the category of ‘interesting’ rather than ‘mission-critical’ projects, so we’d rather not have to maintain expensive infrastructure if possible.</span></p>\n<p><span >I decided to look into using Amazon Web Services <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Simple Storage Service</a> (AWS S3) to store the data. AWS itself is a key-value store, so it seems like a good fit. S3 is a great service because, as the name suggests, it’s a simple service for storing a large number of files. It’s cheap and its capabilities and cost scale well.</span></p>\n<p><span >However, storing and updating up to 80 million very small keys (one per DOI) isn’t very clever, and certainly isn’t practical.

However, the whole Hadoop “Big Data” movement was predicated on a return to batch processing files. Commoditisation of services like S3 and the shift to do more in the browser have precipitated a bit of a rethink. The movement to abandon LAMP stacks and use static site generators is picking up pace. The term ‘serverless architecture’ is hard to avoid if you read <a href=\"https://hn.algolia.com/?query=serverless%20architecture&sort=byDate&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story\">certain news sites</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span >Using Apache Spark (with its brilliant <a href=\"http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#resilient-distributed-datasets-rdds\">RDD concept</a>) was useful for bootstrapping the data processing for Chronograph, but the new code has an entirely flat-file workflow.

This post outlines some of the cases in which we’ve seen fake DOIs used and why we recommend against doing so.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-using-doi-like-strings-as-internal-identifiersspan\"><span >Using DOI-like strings as internal identifiers</span></h2>\n<p><span >Some of our members use DOI-like strings as internal identifiers for their manuscript tracking systems. These only get registered as real DOIs with Crossref once an article is published. This seems relatively harmless, except that, frequently, the unregistered DOI-like strings for unpublished (e.g. under review or rejected manuscripts) content ‘escape’ into the public as well. People attempting to use these DOI-like strings get understandably confused and angry when they don’t resolve or otherwise work as DOIs. After years of experiencing the frustration that these DOI-like things cause, we have taken to recommending that our members not use DOI-like strings as their internal identifiers.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-using-doi-like-strings-in-access-control-compliance-applicationsspan\"><span >Using DOI-like strings in access control compliance applications</span></h3>\n<p><span >We’ve also had members use DOI-like strings as the basis for systems that they use to detect and block tools designed to bypass the member’s access control system and bulk-download content. The methods employed by our members have fallen into two broad categories:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Spider (or robot) traps.</span></li>\n<li><span >Proxy bait.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"spider-traps\">Spider traps</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1849 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/06/web-150x150.png\" alt=\"spider trap\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/06/web-150x150.png 150w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/06/web-300x300.png 300w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/06/web.png 729w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 85vw, 150px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span >A “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_trap\">spider trap</a>” is essentially a tripwire that allows a site owner to detect when a spider/robot is crawling their site to download content. The technique involves embedding a special trigger URL in a public page on a web site. The URL is embedded such that a normal user should not be able see it or follow it, but an automated bot (aka “spider”) will detect it and follow it. The theory is that when one of these trap URLs is followed, the website owner can then conclude that the ip address from which it was followed harbours a bot and take action. Usually the action is to inform the organisation from which the bot is connecting and to ask them to block it. But sometimes triggering a spider trap has resulted in the IP address associated with it being instantly cut off. This, in turn, can affect an entire university’s access to said member’s content.</span></p>\n<p><span >When a spider/bot trap includes a DOI-like string, then we have seen some particularly pernicious problems as they can trip-up legitimate tools and activities as well. For example, a bibliographic management browser plugin might automatically extract DOIs and retrieve metadata on pages visited by a researcher. If the plugin were to pick up one of these spider traps DOI-like strings, it might inadvertently trigger the researcher being blocked- or worse- the researcher’s entire university being blocked. In the past, this has even been a problem for Crossref itself. We periodically run tools to test DOI resolution and to ensure that our members are properly displaying DOIs, Crossmarks, and metadata as per their member obligations. We’ve occasionally been blocked when we ran across the spider traps as well.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"proxy-bait\">Proxy bait</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1848 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/06/bait-150x150.png\" alt=\"proxy bait\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/06/bait-150x150.png 150w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/06/bait-300x300.png 300w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/06/bait.png 729w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 85vw, 150px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span >Using proxy bait is similar to using a spider trap, but it has an important difference. It does not involve embedding specially crafted DOI like strings on the member’s website itself. The DOI-like strings are instead fed directly to tools designed to subvert the member’s access control systems. These tools, in turn, use proxies on a subscriber’s network to retrieve the “bait” DOI-like string. When the member sees one of these special DOI-like strings being requested from a particular institution, they then know that said institution’s network harbours a proxy. In theory this technique never exposes the DOI-like strings to the public and automated tools should not be able to stumble upon them. However, recently one of our members had some of these DOI-like strings “escape” into the public and at least one of them was indexed by Google. The problem was compounded because people clicking on these DOI-like strings sometimes ended having their university’s IP address banned from the member’s web site. As you can imagine, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth. We are convinced, in this case, that the member was doing their best to make sure the DOI-like strings never entered the public. But they did nonetheless. We think this just underscores how hard it is to ensure DOI-like strings remain private and why we recommend our members not use them.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-pedantry-and-terminologyspan\"><span >Pedantry and terminology</span></h2>\n<p><span >Notice that we have not used the phrase “fake DOI” yet. This is because, internally, at least, we have distinguished between “DOI-like strings” and “fake DOIs.” The terminology might be daft, but it is what we’ve used in the past and some of our members at least will be familiar with it. We don’t expect anybody outside of Crossref to know this.</span></p>\n<p><span >To us, the following is not a DOI:</span></p>\n<p><span >10.5454/JPSv1i220161014</span></p>\n<p><span >It is simply a string of alphanumeric characters that copy the DOI syntax. We call them “DOI-like strings.” It is not registered with any DOI registration agency and one cannot lookup metadata for it. If you try to “resolve” it, you will simply get an error. Here, you can try it. Don’t worry- clicking on it will not disable access for your university.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5454/JPSv1i220161014\" target=\"_blank\">http://doi.org/10.5454/JPSv1i220161014</a></p>\n<p><span >The following is what we have sometimes called a “fake DOI”</span></p>\n<p><span >10.5555/12345678</span></p>\n<p><span >It is registered with Crossref, resolves to a fake article in a fake journal called The Journal of Psychoceramics (the study of Cracked Pots) run by a fictitious author (Josiah Carberry) who has a fake ORCID (<a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097\"><a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097\" target=\"_blank\">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097</a></a>) but who is affiliated with a real university (<a href=\"http://www.brown.edu\">Brown University</a>).</span></p>\n<p><span >Again, you can try it.</span></p>\n<p><span ><a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5555/12345678\"><a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5555/12345678\" target=\"_blank\">http://doi.org/10.5555/12345678</a></a></span></p>\n<p><span >And you can even look up metadata for it.</span></p>\n<p><span ><a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.5555/12345678\"><a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.5555/12345678\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.5555/12345678</a></a></span></p>\n<p><span >Our dirty little secret is that this “fake DOI” was registered and is controlled by Crossref.</span></p>\n<p><span >Why does this exist? Aren’t we subverting the scholarly record? Isn’t this awful? Aren’t we at the very least hypocrites? And how does a real university feel about having this fake author and journal associated with them?</span></p>\n<p><span >Well- the DOI is using a prefix that we use for testing. It follows a long tradition of test identifiers starting with “5”. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_(telephone_number)\">Fake phone numbers in the US start with “555”</a>. Many credit card companies <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160707151357/https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm\">reserve fake numbers starting with “5”</a>. For example, Mastercard’s are “5555555555554444” and “5105105105105100.”</span></p>\n<p><span >We have created this fake DOI, the fake journal and the fake ORCID so that we can test our systems and demonstrate interoperable features and tools. The fake author, Josiah Carberry, is <a href=\"http://library.brown.edu/hay/carberry.php\">a long-running joke at Brown University</a>. He even has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_S._Carberry\">Wikipedia entry</a>. There are also a lot of other DOIs under the test prefix “5555.”</span></p>\n<p><span >We acknowledge that the term “fake DOI” might not be the best in this case- but it is a term we’ve used internally at least and it is worth distinguishing it from the case of DOI-like strings mentioned above.</span></p>\n<p><span >But back to the important stuff….</span></p>\n<p><span >As far as we know, none of our members has ever registered a “fake DOI” (as defined above) in order to detect and prevent the circumvention of their access control systems. If they had, we would consider it much more serious than the mere creation of DOI-like strings. The information associated with registered DOIs becomes part of the persistent scholarly citation record. Many, many third party systems and tools make use of our API and metadata including bibliographic management tools, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining\">TDM</a> tools, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_research_information_system\">CRIS</a> systems, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics\">altmetrics</a> services, etc. It would be a very bad thing if people started to worry that the legitimate use of registered DOIs could inadvertently block them from accessing content. Crossref DOIs are designed to encourage discovery and access- not block it.</span></p>\n<p><span >And again, we have absolutely no evidence that any of our members has registered fake DOIs.</span></p>\n<p><span >But just in case, we will continue to discourage our members from using DOI-like strings and/or registering fake DOIs.</span></p>\n<p><span >This has been a public service announcement from the identifier dweebs at Crossref.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-image-creditsspan\"><span >Image Credits</span></h2>\n<p><span >Unless otherwise noted, included images purchased from <a href=\"https://thenounproject.com/\">The Noun Project</a></span></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Outreach Day DC.

But to do so, you have to take an extra and hitherto obscure step to enable reference distribution.\n<em>[EDIT 6th June 2022 - all references are now open by default with the March 2022 board vote to remove any restrictions on reference distribution].</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"how\">How?</h2>\n<p>Many members deposit references to Crossref as part of their participation in Crossref’s <a href=\"http://www.crossref.org/citedby/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CitedBy</a> service. However - for historical reasons too tedious to go into- participation in CitedBy does not automatically make references available via Crossref’s standard APIs. In order for publishers to distribute references along with standard bibliographic metadata, publishers need to either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Crossref <a href=\"mailto:support@crossref.org\">support</a> and ask them to turn on reference distribution for all of the prefixes they manage.</li>\n<li>Set the <a href=\"http://data.crossref.org/reports/help/schema_doc/4.4.1/schema_4_4_1.html#reference_distribution_opts.att\" target=\"_blank\"><code>reference_distribution_opt</code></a> element to <code>any</code> for each content item registered where they want to make references openly available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Either of these steps will allow references for the affected member DOIs to be distributed without restriction through all of Crossrefs APIs and bulk metadata dumps.</p>\n<p>Note that by doing this, you are <strong>not</strong> enabling the open querying of your CitedBy data- you are simply allowing the references that you already deposit to be redistributed to interested parties via our public APIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who\">Who?</h2>\n<p>So who does this now? Well, at the moment not many members have enabled this feature. How could they? They probably didn’t know it existed.  At the time of writing this 29 publishers have enabled reference distribution for at least some of their DOIs.</p>\n<p>But that’s why we are writing this post. Given the interest expressed by our members, we expect the list to start growing quickly over the next few months. Particularly now that they know they <strong>can</strong> do it and have clear instructions on <strong>how</strong> to do it. 🙂</p>\n<p>If you are of a geeky persuasion and want to see the list of publishers who are doing this, you can check via our API.</p>\n<p>The following query will just show you the total number of members who are distributing references for at least some of their DOIs.</p>\n<p >\n<span >https://api.crossref.org/v1/members?filter=has-public-references:true&rows=0</span>\n</p>\n<p>And this query will allow you to page through the member records and see who is distributing references.</p>\n<p >\n<span >https://api.crossref.org/v1/members?filter=has-public-references:true</span>\n</p>\n<p>That cool, but can you see how many total DOIs have reference distribution enabled? No, but will will be adding that capability to our API soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"omg-omg-omg-does-this-mean-i-can-get-references-from-apicrossreforg\">OMG! OMG! OMG! Does this mean I can get references from api.crossref.org?</h2>\n<p><del>Yep. But before you get too excited- note above that not many of our members are doing this yet and that our API is still being updated to allow you to better query this information. At the moment references are not included in our JSON representation- they are only included in our XML representation. You can get the XML for a Crossref DOI either through <a href=\"http://www.crosscite.org/cn/\" target=\"_blank\">content negotiation</a>, or by using the following incantation on our API (using an <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/\" target=\"_blank\">eLife</a> DOI as an example):</del></p>\n<p><del><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.7554/eLife.10288.xml</code></del></p>\n<p><del>As we update our API to better support querying DOIs that include references, you will see the new functionality reflected in our documentation at:</del></p>\n<div class=\"shortcode-divwrap service-red\">\n<span><strong>Yes.</strong> 🤗.

Dario — who co-authored in 2010 the Altmetrics Manifesto — has been interested in understanding how scholarly citations are used in Wikipedia. Over the years, Wikipedia contributors have made extensive use of references to the scientific literature using DOIs, and by doing so they have created a resource that represents today in many ways the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_as_the_front_matter_to_all_research\">“front matter to all research”</a>. There is growing interest in the community in understanding how DOIs are being used in Wikipedia and in non traditional scholarship.</span></p>\n<p><span >During our discussions the subject of Wikipedia’s gradual transition to HTTPS was raised: we anticipated that this change would affect our data gathering.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-changesspan\"><span >Changes</span></h2>\n<p><span >When you’re reading webpage and click on a link to another page, your web browser will usually tell the server of that second page the last page you were on. This forms the basis of trackers like Google Analytics.</span></p>\n<p><span >In the days before HTTPS, the next site would know the full URL that you were previously on. With the change to HTTPS, this was reduced to just sending the domain name and not the full URL, or no data at all if you click from an HTTPS page to HTTP.</span></p>\n<p><span >DOI hyperlinks are just like any other hyperlink, and are mostly HTTP not HTTPS.</span></p>\n<p><span >Up until 2015, Wikipedia was served over HTTP, only switching to HTTPS when users were logged in or if they requested it. The Wikimedia Foundation started planning to move to HTTPS and we knew that if they did that, and continued to use HTTP DOIs then we would lose valuable research data.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-a-planspan\"><span >A Plan</span></h2>\n<p><span >We decided that the best course of action was to try and change the DOIs in Wikipedia to use HTTPS. Simple, right?</span></p>\n<p><span >After some further research, Dario <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikimedia_referrer_policy\">posted a proposal</a> on how to mitigate the impact of the HTTPS rollout, to make sure that Wikipedia can still signal its importance as a traffic source, while preserving the privacy of its users. <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research_talk:Wikimedia_referrer_policy\">Discussion followed</a> and the conclusion was to change the format of every single DOI on Wikipedia, which fortunately could be done without having to edit millions of pages. You can read the full story in <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/real-time-stream-of-dois-being-cited-in-wikipedia/\">this post from a year ago</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span >The result of this effort was that well in advance of the HTTPS switchover, the DOI links were ready to continue reporting referral data.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-the-switchspan\"><span >The Switch</span></h2>\n<p><span >In June 2015 the Wikimedia foundation made the <a href=\"http://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/\">announcement that they were finalising the switch</a>, and that within a few weeks all traffic would be HTTPS.</span></p>\n<p><span >We held our breath. Would it work? Would we lose all referral data from Wikipedia sites? In February 2016 <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99174#2053812\">the last piece of the puzzle fell into place</a> as Wikipedia gained a ‘meta referrer’ tag to explicitly specify how they would like referrers to be sent: a detailed report on the effect of this change is coming up on the Wikimedia Foundation’s blog.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-the-resultsspan\"><span >The results</span></h2>\n<p><span >As detailed in <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/where-do-doi-clicks-come-from/\">the last blog post</a> the traffic that we measured coming from Wikipedia doesn’t seem to have slowed down during 2015:</span></p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/month-top-10-filtered-domains-1.png\" alt=\"month-top-10-filtered-domains\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p><span >I’d call that a success!

Calls for prospective registration of clinical trials <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3760920\">date back to the 1980s</a> and it is now becoming increasingly commonplace, recognising that the quality of research lies in the questions it asks and the methods it uses, not the results observed.</span><figure id=\"attachment_1581\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/04/Trial-registration.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1581\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/04/Trial-registration.jpg\" alt=\"Uptake of trial registration since 2000\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/04/Trial-registration.jpg 868w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/04/Trial-registration-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/04/Trial-registration-768x448.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Uptake of trial registration year-on-year since 2000</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span >Building on this, a number of journals and funders – starting with BioMed Central’s <em>Trials</em> <a href=\"http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1468-6708-6-15\">over 10 years ago</a> – have also pushed for the prospective publication of a study’s protocol and, more recently, statistical analysis plan. The idea that null and non-confirmatory results have value and should be published has also gained increasing support.</span></p>\n<p><span >Over the last ten years, there has been a general trend towards increasing transparency. So what is the problem? Well, to borrow an analogy from Jeremy Grimshaw, co-Editor-in-Chief of <a href=\"http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/\"><em>Trials</em></a> – we’ve gone from <a href=\"http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2014/05/30/the-consort-statement-in-2014/\">Miró to Pollock</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span >Although a results paper may reference a published study protocol, there is nothing to link that report to subsequent published articles; and no link from the protocol itself to the results article.</span></p>\n<p><span >A <a href=\"http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-15-369\">single clinical trial can result in multiple publications</a>: the study protocol and traditional results paper or papers, as well as commentaries, secondary analyses and, eventually, systematic reviews, among others, many published in different journals, years apart. This situation is further complicated by an ever-growing body of literature.</span></p>\n<p><span >Researchers need access to all of these articles if they are to reliably evaluate bias or selective reporting in a research object, but – as any systematic reviewer can tell you – actually finding them all is like looking for a needle in a haystack. When you don’t know how many needles there are. With the haystack still growing.</span></p>\n<p><span >That’s where we come in. The advent of trial registration means that there is a unique identifier associated with every clinical trial, at the study-level, rather than the article level. Building on this, the <a href=\"http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2014/01/31/threaded-publications-one-step-closer/\">Linked Clinical Trials project</a> set out to connect all articles relating to an individual trial together using its trial registration number (TRN).</span></p>\n<p><span >By adapting the existing Crossmark standard, we have captured additional metadata about an article, namely the TRN and the trial registry, with this information then associated with the article’s DOI on publication. This means that you will be able to pull all articles related to an individual clinical trial from the Crossmark dialogue box on any relevant article. </span></p>\n<p><span >This obviously has huge implications for the way science is reported and used. By quickly and easily linking to related published articles, it will enable editors, reviewers and researchers to evaluate any selective reporting in the study, and help to provide far greater context for the results.</span></p>\n<p><span >As all the metadata will be open access (CC0), with no copyright, it will also be possible to access this article ‘thread’ through the Crossref Metadata Search, or independently through an application programming interface (API). This provides a platform for others to build on, with many already looking to take the next step, such as Ben Goldacre’s new <a href=\"http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-016-1290-8\">Open Trials initiative</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span >However, in order for this to work, we must capture as many articles and trials as possible to create a truly comprehensive thread of publications. We currently have data from the NIHR Libraries, PLoS and, of course, BioMed Central, but need more publishers and journals to join us in depositing clinical trial metadata. After all, without metadata, this is all merely wishful thinking.</span></p>\n<p><span >Let’s hope we’re the pebble that starts the landslide.</span></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Members will soon be able to assign Crossref DOIs to preprints","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/members-will-soon-be-able-to-assign-crossref-dois-to-preprints/","published":"Thu, 05 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000","description":"TL;DR By August 2016, Crossref will enable its members to assign Crossref DOIs to preprints.

Well, to understand that you need to know a little Crossref history.</span></p>\n<p><span ><i><span >(cue music and fade to sepia) </span></i></span></p>\n<p><span ><br /> <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/cue-music-fade-to-sepia.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1606\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/cue-music-fade-to-sepia.jpg\" alt=\"ukelele memory\" width=\"283\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/cue-music-fade-to-sepia.jpg 800w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/cue-music-fade-to-sepia-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/cue-music-fade-to-sepia-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/cue-music-fade-to-sepia-683x1024.jpg 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 85vw, 283px\" /></a>When Crossref was founded, one of its major goals was to clarify the scholarly record by uniquely identifying formally published scholarly content on the web so that it could be cited precisely. At the time, our members had two primary concerns:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span >That a Crossref DOI should point to one intellectually discrete scholarly document. That is, they did not want one Crossref DOI to be assigned to two documents that appeared largely similar, but which might vary in intellectually significant ways.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span >That two DOIs should not point to the same intellectually discrete document. They wanted it to be easy for all to tell when the same discrete intellectual content was cited.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >As such, when Crossref was founded, we developed a complex set of rules that were colloquially known by our members as Crossref’s rules “prohibiting the assignment of DOIs to duplicative content.”</span></p>\n<p><span ><i><span >(cue music, show wavy lines, return to color)</span></i></span></p>\n<p><span >Well… as we gained experience in assigning DOIs, many of these rules have been amended or discarded when it became apparent that they didn’t actually support common scholarly citation practice and/or otherwise muddied the scholarly citation record.</span></p>\n<p><span >For example, sometimes a document will be re-published in a special issue or an anthology. Before the advent of the DOI, it was common citation practice to always cite a document in the context in which it was read. The context of the document could, after all, affect the interpretation or crediting of the work. But it would be impossible to support this common citation practice if we were to assign the same Crossref DOI to the article on both its original context and in its re-published form. Our current recommendation in these situations is to assign separate DOIs to content that is republished in another context.</span></p>\n<p><span ><span >Another example occurs when a particular copy of a two identical documents has been annotated. For example, though the </span><i><span >Handbook to The birds of Australia</span></i><span > By John Gould has its own Crossref DOI (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.8367\" target=\"_blank\">http://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.8367</a>), another copy of the same book has been hand-annotated by </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin\"><span >Charles Darwin</span></a><span > and </span><i><span >also</span></i><span > has its own, different Crossref DOI (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.50403\" target=\"_blank\">http://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.50403</a>). Historians of science quite reasonably may want to refer and cite the particular annotated copy of this historic document.</span></span></p>\n<p>__<span ><i><span >[So much for not assigning two separate Crossref DOIs to identical documents.]</span></i></span></p>\n<p><span >Finally, we should note a far more common example practice in our industry. Our members often make content available online with a Crossref DOI before they consider it to be formally published. This practice goes by a number of names including “publish ahead of print,” “article in progress,” “article in press,” “online ahead of print,” “online first”, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span ><span >But in each case, the process is the same- the publisher is assigning a Crossref DOI to the document soon after it has been accepted for publication and this </span><i><span >same</span></i><span > Crossref DOI is carried over to the finally published article. Again, this practice just reflects that the “intellectual” content of the accepted manuscript should not change between the point of acceptance and the point of publication, so of the purposes of “citation” they are largely interchangeable.</span></span></p>\n<p><span ><i><span >[So much for not assigning one Crossref DOI to two versions of the same document.]</span></i></span></p>\n<p><span >Now, in the above cases it also helps to clarify the scholarly record to also specify that the respective Crossref DOIs of the original and the “duplicative” work are related, and we encourage our members to make these connections explicit when they can. Nonetheless, it is paramount in both cases to allow the “duplicative works” to be cited precisely and independently.</span></p>\n<p><span >Which brings us back to preprints.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-bthe-case-for-preprintsbspan\"><span ><b>The case for preprints</b></span></h3>\n<p><span >First we should define what was meant by preprints because even this commonly used term sometimes means different things to different communities. We have historically considered preprints to be any version of a manuscript that is intended for publication but that has not yet been submitted to a publisher for formal review. Note that this definition does not include “accepted manuscripts” which -as we noted above- often already have Crossref DOIs assigned to them soon after acceptance.</span></p>\n<p><span >Crossref members originally worried that, by assigning DOIs to preprints, we would end up muddying the scholarly record. They worried that the very presence of a Crossref DOI would be interpreted to mean that the content to which it had been applied had gone through a formal publishing process. And unlike the case with “accepted manuscripts”, the difference between intellectual content of a preprint and the final published version can sometimes be substantial. At the time, it seemed that the scholarly record would be clarified by prohibiting the assignment of DOIs to preprints.</span></p>\n<p><span >But again, changes in the scholarly communication landscape have led us to -as the youngsters say- pivot.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-ba-koanbspan\"><span ><b>A Koan</b></span></h3>\n<p><span ><i><span >When is a preprint a preprint?</span></i></span></p>\n<p><span ><span ><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/contemplative-hand.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1609\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/contemplative-hand-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"contemplative hand\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/contemplative-hand-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/contemplative-hand.jpg 577w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 85vw, 200px\" /></a>Crossref has always been </span><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/?ion=1&espv=2#q=define:catholic\"><span >catholic</span></a><span > in its definition of “publisher.” Many of our members do not consider “publishing” to be their primary mission. The OECD and World Bank are two obvious cases here. But our membership also includes government departments, universities and archives. In these latter cases they have traditionally assigned Crossref DOIs to things like internal reports, grey literature, working papers, etc. This activity was clearly within the original rules set out by Crossref. And this is where our koan comes into play- “when is a preprint a preprint?”</span></span></p>\n<p><span ><span >It is often difficult to predict when something </span><i><span >might</span></i><span > eventually be formally published.

After all, </span><i><span >everything</span></i><span > could potentially be submitted for publication (Sometimes it seems everything is.)</span></span></p>\n<p><span ><span >This is the dilemma that was faced by a few of our members. For example, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which runs </span><a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/\"><span >bioRxiv</span></a><span > has been a Crossref member since 2000 and has assigned over 35,000 Crossref DOIs. They have been assiduous in trying to stick to Crossref’s rules about preprints. Furthermore, they have taken equal care to ensure that preprints in bioRxiv are labeled as such and linked to the final publication (via a Crossref journal DOI) when it is available. This takes a lot of work. </span></span></p>\n<p><span >But often bioRxiv simply has no way of telling when the authors of a working paper or report might suddenly decide to submit their work for publication. So they have found themselves occasionally and inadvertently violating Crossref’s rules on preprints because they had no way of predicting when something would magically transform from being an innocuous working paper into a fraught preprint.</span></p>\n<p><span >It is a testament to bioRxiv that they have persevered. We have other members who face the same problem. They have not given up. They have not gone elsewhere for their DOIs.</span></p>\n<p><span >Which brings us to our next point.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-bnot-all-doisbspan\"><span ><b>Not All DOIs</b></span></h3>\n<p><span ><span >Have you noticed how often we use the phrase “Crossref DOIs?” Were you wondering if this was an annoying affectation or an example of a marketing department gone mad? It’s neither. It is an essential distinction that we make because Crossref is just one of </span><a href=\"https://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html\"><span >several DOI registration agencies</span></a><span >. Although </span><i><span >all DOIs</span></i><span > are “compatible” in the minimal sense that you can “resolve” them to a location on the web, that does not mean that all DOIs work identically. Different DOI registration agencies have different constituencies, different services, different governance models and different rules covering what their members can assign their respective DOIs to.</span></span></p>\n<p><span ><span >This was not the case when Crossref was founded and our rules were first drafted. At the time, Crossref was the </span><i><span >only</span></i><span > registration agency and, as such, the rule which prohibited the assignment of Crossref DOIs to preprints kinda worked. But it was unworkable in the longer term.</span></span></p>\n<p><span >Quite naturally, new DOI registration agencies have been established for different communities with different primary use-cases. While Crossref could have a rule prohibiting the assignment of Crossref DOIs to preprints, there was nothing stopping another registration agency from allowing (indeed, encouraging) its members to assign DOIs to preprints.</span></p>\n<p><span >So the simple fact is that DOIs could be assigned to preprints regardless of Crossref’s old rules. By continuing to prohibit the practice at Crossref we were just making life for some of our existing members more difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span >And it has become clear that the situation would only get worse as more of our members started to roll-out new publishing and business models.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-bbusiness-model-neutral-bspan\"><span ><b>Business model neutral  </b></span></h3>\n<p><span >Crossref has always been business model neutral. We need to adapt and change to support our members’ business models, not the other way around.</span></p>\n<p><span >A number of our members are starting to adopt publishing workflows that are more fluid and public than established publishing models. These new workflows make much of the submission and review process open, which, in turn often blurs the historically hard distinctions between a draft manuscript, a preprint, a revised proof, an accepted manuscript, the “final” published version, and subsequent corrections and updates. Where as in classic publishing models a document went through a series of discrete state-changes (some in public, many in private) new publishing workflows treat document versions as a continuum, most of which are made available publicly and which consequently may be used cited at almost any point in the publishing process.</span></p>\n<p><span >In short, Crossref’s members increasingly need the flexibility to assign DOIs at different points in the publishing lifecycle. Rather than enforce rules that enshrined an existing publishing or business model, we need to work with our members to establish and adopt new DOI assignment practices which support evolving publishing models whilst maintaining a clear citation record and which lets researchers easily identify the best available version (BAV) of a document or research object.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/flinty-exterior.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1615\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/flinty-exterior-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"flinty-exterior\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/flinty-exterior-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/05/flinty-exterior.jpg 577w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 85vw, 200px\" /></a>So you see, not all of our motivations for this change in policy are opportunistic or prosaic. Underneath our gruff and flinty exterior is a soft, idealistic center. There are principles at work here as well.</p>\n<p><span ><b>What next</b></span></p>\n<p><span >So this isn’t just matter of changing our rules and display guidelines. We also have to make some schema changes, and adjust our services and APIs to clearly distinguish between preprints and accepted manuscripts/versions of record. Additionally, we will be building tools to make it much easier for our members to link preprints to the final published article (and vice versa). Finally, we need to update our documentation to help our members take advantage of the new functionality. We expect that everything will be in place by the end of August, 2016, at which point you will see another announcement from us.</span></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Crossref Brand update: new names, logos, guidelines, + video","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-brand-update-new-names-logos-guidelines-and-video/","published":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000","description":"It can be a pain when companies rebrand as it usually requires some coordinated updating of wording and logos on websites, handouts, and slides.

We invited Alex Stinson, a project manager at </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_Wikipedia_Library\"><span >The Wikipedia Library </span></a><span >(and one of our first guest bloggers) to explain more:</span></span></p>\n<p><span ><span >Wikipedia provides the most public gateway to academic and scholarly research. With millions of citations to academic as well as non-academic but reliable sources, like those produced by newspapers, its ecosystem of 5 million English Wikipedia articles and 35 million articles in </span><a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\"><span >hundreds of languages</span></a><span > provides the first stop for researchers in both scholarly and informal research situations. The practice of “checking Wikipedia” has become ubiquitous in a number of fields; for example, Wikipedia is the most visited </span><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4376174/\"><span >source of medical information online</span></a><span >, even providing the first stop for many </span><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23137251\"><span >medical students and medical practitioners when looking for medical literature</span></a><span >.</span></span></p>\n<p><span ><span ><span >The Wikipedia Library prog</span>ram helps Wikipedia’s volunteer editors access and use the best sources in their research and citations.  Through </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:TWL/Publishers\"><span >partnerships</span></a><span > with over fifty leading publishers and aggregators, like JSTOR, Project Muse, Elsevier, Newspapers.com, Highbeam, Oxford University Press and others, we have been able to give over 3000 of our most prolific volunteers access to over 5500 accounts. These are clear, win-win relationships where Wikipedia editors get to use these databases to improve Wikipedia, while in turn linking to authoritative resources and enhancing their discovery. </span></span></p>\n<p><span >JSTOR has been working with us since 2012, providing over 500 accounts to our editors. Kristen Garlock at JSTOR writes: </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><span >“We’re very happy to collaborate with the Wikipedia Library to provide JSTOR access to Wikipedia editors. Supporting the initiative to increase editor access to scholarly resources and improve the quality of information and sources on Wikipedia has the potential to help all Wikipedia readers. In addition to providing more discoverability for our institutional subscribers, introducing new audiences to the scholarship on JSTOR them discover access opportunities like our </span><a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/rr\"><span >Register &amp; Read program</span></a><span >.”</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >There are strong signals that Wikipedia’s role in the citation ecosystem helps ensure the best materials reach the public through its over 400 million monthly readers: </span></p>\n<li >\n<span ><span >The latest estimates by Crossref show that Wikipedia has </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/8qO3BYDN67k?t=11m15s\"><span >risen from the 8th most prolific referrer to DOIs to the 5th</span></a><span >. </span></span>\n</li>\n<li >\n<span >Two of our access partners have found that around half of the referrals arriving from Wikipedia were able to authenticate into their subscription resources, suggesting that a large portion of our readers can take advantage of subscriptions provided by scholarly institutions. </span>\n</li>\n<li >\n<span ><span >Wikipedia is highly influential in the open access ecosystem as well, with a recent study showing </span><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07608\"><span >higher citation rates for OA materials </span></a><span >than those behind a paywall.</span></span>\n</li>\n<li >\n<span ><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics\"><span >Altmetrics</span></a><span > tools (such as Altmetric.com, ImpactStory or Plum Analytics) are recognizing Wikipedia’s importance by including Wikipedia citations </span><a href=\"http://www.altmetric.com/blog/new-source-alert-wikipedia/\"><span >in their impact metrics</span></a><span >. </span></span>\n</li>\n<p><span ><span >Despite these advances, we think this is only the beginning of Wikipedia’s impact on the landscape of scholarly research and discovery.

Essential to making the Crossref APIs easily accessible—and facilitating easy tool/app creation and exploration—are programmatic clients for popular languages.

Due to this fact, there is not generally correspondence between the different clients with respect to data outputs. However, I’ve tried to make method names similar across Ruby and Python; although the R client is quite a bit older, so method names differ from the other clients and I’m resistant to changing them so as not to break current users’ projects. In addition, R users are likely to want a data.frame (i.e., table) of results, so we give back that - whereas with Python and Ruby we give back dictionaries and hashes, respectively.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-strongcrossref-clientsstrongspan\"><span ><strong>Crossref clients</strong></span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Python:</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/habanero\"><a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/habanero\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/sckott/habanero</a></a></span></li>\n<li><span >Pypi: <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/habanero\"><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/habanero\" target=\"_blank\">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/habanero</a></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span >Ruby:</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/serrano\"><a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/serrano\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/sckott/serrano</a></a></span></li>\n<li><span >Rubygems: <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/serrano\"><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/serrano\" target=\"_blank\">https://rubygems.org/gems/serrano</a></a></span></li>\n<li><span ><code>serrano</code> also comes with a command line tool of the same name that’s installed when you install <code>serrano</code> (examples below)</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span >R:</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref\"><a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref</a></a></span></li>\n<li><span >CRAN: <a href=\"https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref/\"><a href=\"https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref/</a></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span >Javascript:</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/scienceai/crossref\"><a href=\"https://github.com/scienceai/crossref\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/scienceai/crossref</a></a></span></li>\n<li><span >NPM: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/crossref\"><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/crossref\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/crossref</a></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >I’ll cover the Python, Ruby, and R libraries below.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-stronginstallationstrongspan\"><span ><strong>Installation</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span ><strong><em>Python</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span >on the command line</span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:sh decode:true\"><span >pip install habanero</span></pre>\n<p><span ><em><strong>Ruby</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span >on the command line</span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:sh decode:true\"><span >gem install serrano</span></pre>\n<p><span ><em><strong>R</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span >in an R session</span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:r decode:true\"><span >install.packages(\"rcrossref\")</span></pre>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"span-strongexamplesstrongspan\"><span ><strong>Examples</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span >Output is indicated by the syntax <code>#&gt;</code> in all examples below.</span></p>\n<p><span ><em><strong>Python</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span >in a Python REPL (e.g. <em>iPython</em>)</span></p>\n<p><span >Import the <em>Crossref</em> module from within <em>habanero</em>, and initialize a client</span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:python decode:true\"><span >from habanero import Crossref\ncr = Crossref()</span></pre>\n<p><span >Query for the phrase “ecology”</span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:python decode:true\"><span >x = cr.works(query = \"ecology\", limit = 5)</span></pre>\n<p><span >Index to various parts of the output</span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:python decode:true\"><span >x['message']['total-results']\n#&gt; 276188</span></pre>\n<p><span >Extract similar data items from each result.

The Crossref API has parameters for paging (see <a href=\"https://github.com/Crossref/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md#rows\">rows</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Crossref/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md#offset\">offset</a>), but large values of either can lead to long response times and potentially timeouts (i.e., request failure). The API has a deep paging feature that can be used when large data volumes are desired. This is made possible via Solr’s cursor feature (e.g., <a href=\"http://solr.pl/en/2014/03/10/solr-4-7-efficient-deep-paging/\">blog post on it</a>). Here’s a run down of how to use it:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span ><code>cursor</code>: each method in each client library that allows deep paging has a <code>cursor</code> parameter that if you set to <code>*</code> will tell the Crossref API you want deep paging.</span></li>\n<li><span ><code>cursor_max</code>: for boring reasons we need to have feedback from the user when they want to stop, since each request comes back with a cursor value that we can make the next request with, thus, an additional parameter <code>cursor_max</code> is used to indicate the number of results you want back.</span></li>\n<li><span ><code>limit</code>: this parameter when not using deep paging determines number of results to get back. however, when deep paging, this parameter sets the chunk size. (note that the max. value for this parameter is 1000)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >For example, <code>cursor=&amp;#8221;*&amp;#8221;</code> states that you want deep paging, <code>cursor_max</code> states maximum results you want back, and <code>limit</code> determines how many results per request to fetch.</span></p>\n<p><span ><em><strong>Python</strong></em></span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:python decode:true \"><span >from habanero import Crossref\ncr = Crossref()\ncr.works(query = \"widget\", cursor = \"*\", cursor_max = 500)</span></pre>\n<p><span ><em><strong>Ruby</strong></em></span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:ruby decode:true\"><span >require 'serrano'\nSerrano.works(query: \"widget\", cursor: \"*\", cursor_max: 500)</span></pre>\n<p><span ><em><strong>R</strong></em></span></p>\n<pre class=\"theme:solarized-light lang:r decode:true\"><span >library(\"rcrossref\")\ncr_works(query = \"widget\", cursor = \"*\", cursor_max = 500)\n</span></pre>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"span-text-mining-clientsspan\"><span >Text mining clients</span></h3>\n<p><span >Just a quick note that I’ve begun a few text-mining clients for Python and Ruby, focused on using the low level clients discussed above.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Python: <a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/pyminer\"><a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/pyminer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/sckott/pyminer</a></a></span></li>\n<li><span >Ruby: <a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/textminer\"><a href=\"https://github.com/sckott/textminer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/sckott/textminer</a></a></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >Do try them out!</span></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Community responses to our proposal for early content registration","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/community-responses-to-our-proposal-for-early-content-registration/","published":"Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000","description":"TL;DR: We will proceed with implementing the proposed support for registering content before online availability.

Adopting the workflow will be optional and will involve no extra fees.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-backgroundspan\"><span >Background</span></h2>\n<p><span >At the end of January, Crossref issued a “request for community comment” on a proposed new process to support the registration of content including DOIs before online availability. We promised that we would summarize the results of the survey once we had received and analyzed all the responses.</span></p>\n<p><span >Support for Crossref implementing the proposed new workflow was overwhelming. Of the 104 responses, 90 were positive, 7 were neutral and 7 were negative. As such we will proceed to make the necessary changes to better support registering content before online availability. We aim to enable this functionality in the second half of 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span >We received survey responses varying in length from one or two sentences to multiple pages. A lot of the responses also interspersed questions and observations about entirely different issues that were of interest to respondents. As such, it has taken a while for us to analyze the results. We also found it was pretty much impossible for us to tabulate a summary of the responses to the direct questions. Instead we’ll summarize the responses at a high level and then drill down into some of the nuances in the answers and issues that were raised from the responses.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-the-positive-responsesspan\"><span >The positive responses</span></h2>\n<p><span >By “positive” we mean the respondent understood the issues we were trying to address and thought what we were proposing was a reasonable way to address the problems. Here are a few (anonymized) excerpts from the responses:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“[This] is very timely as we have been made aware of changes to manuscript deposit requirements for UK authors. Authors who partake in the REF system will have to deposit articles at their manuscript stage before publication. We need to set an embargo on the articles so that they only become discoverable at some point after the publication date. Ideally we would like this to happen with all articles regardless of where they are from as authors will put their own work up on open access sites.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“Your proposal and the associated workflow look good to us and will help with our media embargo timelines, as well as our authors’ institutional requirements.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“The workflows and solutions seem reasonable … The temporary landing page seems like a sustainable technical solution. Hosting by Crossref is key to this – there is no way that all publishers would otherwise take on maintaining temporary pages. And having a standard display for metadata consistency is crucial too.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“Early assignment and recording of DOIs from the point of acceptance forms a key step in [the university’s] proposed ‘Submit-accept-deposit’ workflow. We welcome the proposal by Crossref to enable early assignment of DOIs for publications.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >Note that a positive response did not mean the respondents thought the problems necessarily applied to them or that they would necessarily be implementing the changes - just that what we were proposing seemed sound for those who needed to address the issues.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“While not directly relevant to our business the proposal seems aimed to protect the integrity of DOIs and Crossref’s role and that is not a bad thing.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“I would consider it an irresponsible use of the system on the part of a publisher to circulate dois that don’t (yet) work. This is bound to lead to frustration with users encountering errors. However I appreciate that this situation may arise in some workflows and therefore your proposals to implement temporary landing pages make sense.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“I was not aware of these issues, but think that your solutions seem feasible. We are a small journal and generally don’t add doi’s or publish until the article is complete (i.e., we don’t post anything that’s just accepted - only finalized). So we would be unlikely to update our workflow.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >Also, though respondents might have been generally positive about the proposal - that didn’t always mean they were also sanguine about it. For example, several shared concerns about the potential costs of changing their workflows.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“[we] would consider implementing this change into our workflow. Limiting factors would include the effort and additional cost to enable our paper management system vendor…”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“My only comment is that the process needs to be streamlined as much as possible so small publishers without great technical capacity will not be burdened with twice the work or with additional expense. After reading through Crossref’s proposal, I believe you have taken such things into account and will implement an efficient and worthwhile system.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“The workflow makes sense as a solution to the problem you describe […] but will require extensive workflow changes on our end in order to implement. Speaking for a small publishing house I’m not sure it’s reasonable to expect this from us on any short term.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >Several of the positive respondents also wondered about how we would handle particular edge cases (e.g. rescinding acceptances) and/or offered suggestions to improve the proposal. We will discuss these further at the end of this post.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-the-neutral-responsesspan\"><span >The neutral responses</span></h2>\n<p><span >The responses we categorised as “neutral” were generally too short to conclude much about. They consisted of one or two sentences that said something like “this doesn’t apply to me.” It wasn’t clear whether it didn’t apply to them because they didn’t have the problems we described or because they’d already solved the problems we described (e.g. by providing their own interim landing pages). They also didn’t comment on the applicability to other members or whether they thought the issues might eventually affect them.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-the-negative-responsesspan\"><span >The negative responses</span></h2>\n<p><span >We categorised responses as “negative” when the member rejected that the issues we outlined were actual problems or they rejected the mechanisms we were proposing to address the problems.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“…a formal letter of acceptance on a letter in PDF will be OK for </span><span >authors. Why a DOI is better?”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“…I am aware of funder and institutional requirements for authors to take action on acceptance of manuscripts for publication in journals but don’t think the time pressure is so high that it has to happen in short time between acceptance and published ahead of print online…”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“Of all the accepted-but-not-yet-published papers in existence at any time, the number whose existence must be demonstrated to promotion and tenure review boards must be awfully small.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >There are a few common themes here. The first is that, historically, the industry has been content with acceptance letters as proof of publication and that it was relatively rare for authors to have to produce such proof.</span></p>\n<p><span >The problem that has led us to propose support for a modified workflow is that now we have situations where all the researchers in a country require such letters on a regular basis - not just when they are up for promotion or tenure. This is the new reality faced by researchers and institutions who are subject to regular national evaluation schemes like the <a href=\"http://www.ref.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">REF</a> and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160229001254/http://www.arc.gov.au/era-faqs\" target=\"_blank\">ERA</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span >One of the negative respondents added:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“This is very familiar territory. It’s definitely coming out of STEM.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >Indeed, the initial pressure to support the earlier registration of DOIs is certainly falling on our members who focus on STEM publishing. Researchers in the STEM fields are generally under more pressure to publish articles frequently and they are primarily affected by emerging funder mandates. The relatively high research output in STEM fields combined with the need for regular compliance checks and regular evaluation schemes is creating an environment that requires more automated mechanisms to keep track of publications. Asking for and processing letters of acceptance in these situations just doesn’t scale.</span></p>\n<p><span >Some of the negative responses also questioned our assertions about the hazards of promulgating unregistered DOI-like strings and/or the problems associated with the delay between when content is made available online and when the content is registered.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“I don’t buy the argument that people lose trust in DOIs in general because they once tried to resolve one and it didn’t lead to an article. By the same argument, URLs in general are similarly undermined.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“where authors ask me for their DOIs so they can accurately cite the paper in another publication or use it for grants and applications. I explain that it won’t work until the issue as a whole posts and I have never heard back about confusion or distrust of the system.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >To this all we can say is, we have the data. Next to typos, unregistered DOIs account for the second greatest category of failed resolutions on the Crossref system. Our help desk has to explain them to researchers constantly. We have promoted DOIs as being more robust, persistent identifiers than ordinary URLs. People are not surprised when URLs don’t work. They are surprised when DOIs don’t work. We’d like to keep it that way.</span></p>\n<p><span >What seems to be at the the root of the few negative responses - is that most assumed that Crossref was mandating that publishers change their workflow - even if they didn’t face any of the issues outlined in the proposal. There is very little that Crossref <em>mandates</em> to participate. This is by design. Our membership is just too diverse for us to have mandates that can be sensibly applied to all. Still - we should have made it clearer in the proposal that the proposed changes would not be mandated. We will certainly need to make this clearer when we roll out support for the new processes.</span></p>\n<p><span >Oh yeah - one respondent called us out for using the phrase “advanced publication” instead of “advance publication”. For this we are truly sorry. The employee who made this mistake has been dragged out and shotted.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-issues-raised-and-questions-askedspan\"><span >Issues raised and questions asked</span></h2>\n<p><span >Both the positive and negative respondents raised issues, asked questions and provided suggestions regarding the proposal. We will make sure that, when the proposal is implemented, we address all of these issues more clearly, but in the meantime, we thought it would be helpful if we answered some of them briefly here.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Would Crossref charge extra for the new workflow?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> No. We should have made this clear in the proposal. We should have also mentioned that, in the “Crossref-facilitated Early Registration” scenario members will only be charged once they have replaced the “registered_content” metadata with metadata for the published item using one of the existing content schemas (e.g. article, book, confproc).</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Would Crossref require that publishers adopt the new proposed workflows?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> No. But we will recommend them to members who need to address the issues outlined in the proposal. And in general, we will recommend that our members register DOIs as early in the process as practicable.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> What does “acceptance” mean? It was pointed out that there were lots of variations of “acceptance” including “acceptance pending revisions”, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> We would expect that “contingent acceptance” does not constitute final acceptance and that in this case “acceptance” should mean that the publisher has a copy of the manuscript in which the author has made all of the changes asked of them.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Doesn’t “acceptance” works both ways? A researcher has to grant permission to publish to the publisher.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> This is a vital point - the publisher should only register content for which they have already secured the rights to publish.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Collecting and verifying the metadata associated with a paper is expensive and time consuming. As such, some publishers only produce complete and robust metadata after a paper has been accepted. We face a Catch-22. if we deposit metadata immediately after acceptance, it will be sparse and unreliable. If we wait to collect and verify the metadata, then we risk violating some of the emerging mandates. How do we resolve this dilemma?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> This is clearly beyond our control, but we expect that those issuing the mandates will have to make some reasonable accommodations if they expect publishers to register content both early and with reasonably useful metadata.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> How would publishers handle rescinded acceptances?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> Publishers can handle this the same way they handle retractions or withdrawals. Additionally, the registered content type and the “intent to publish” landing page will both support Crossmark for those members who use Crossmark to promulgate corrections to the literature. We will explore adding a new “acceptance rescinded” update type to the Crossmark schema.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> The Crossref DOIs we generate contain embedded publication information such as volume and issue. We don’t know these details at acceptance so how can we register DOIs early? </span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> Many of our members generate Crossref DOIs with embedded semantic information in them such as volume/issue, publication date or even author initials and title. After 16 years of experience, we have found that this tends to be a bad idea. Publication schedules slip. Metadata changes. We will soon be revising our guidelines on DOI best practice in Crossref DOI generation to recommend against embedding such information into the DOI itself. Clearly, if you decide to assign Crossref DOIs at acceptance, you will need to adopt a DOI structure that accommodates this.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Our hosting provider manages DOI registrations for us. If we have to register DOIs earlier in the process, can we have one party (e.g. a manuscript tracking system vendor) register the initial “registered_content” metadata and then have different party (e.g. hosting provider or typesetter) replace that record with the final metadata?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Will you be working with industry vendors to help them support this new workflow?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Will we support the pre-registration of DOIs in the the deposit forms on the Crossref site?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> If Crossref hosts the “intent to publish” landing page, how will publishers be able to account for visits to the page and incorporate that information into their metrics?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> While visitors to the Crossref hosted page will not show up in the publisher’s own hosting platform logs, publishers will be able to easily see how many times their “intent to publish” landing page was accessed by looking at their standard Crossref DOI resolution logs.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Could the Crossref-hosted landing page also include the URL that the DOI will eventually be associated with?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> This is an interesting idea and was suggested by two separate respondents. The challenge will be in explaining to the user that the URL might or might not work. We are also concerned that this would reduce the incentive for publishers to replace the holding page in a timely manner. We’ll explore this option as we continue to work on implementation.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> Would the Crossref-hosted landing page be open to indexing by Google and others? If so, wouldn’t this undermine articles under press embargoes?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong> The idea behind the limited metadata required for registering content is that it allows the publisher to control the balance between discovery (needed to meet funder requirements) and discretion (needed to manage publicity). So yes, the Crossref-hosted landing pages would be open to indexing, but publishers can still control what gets indexed by withholding metadata as needed.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Q:</strong> The table of required metadata elements for the “registered content” type does not include the author. How are such records supposed to be used as proof of acceptance if they do not include the author name?</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>A:</strong><strike> We made a mistake. The table should have included the contributor in the required element column.</strike><strong> Update:</strong> We retract our retraction! We are trying to accommodate several different use cases for &rsquo;early content registration&rsquo; and these different use cases often have contradictory metadata implications. So, for example, including the author is certainly important for monitoring mandate compliance. However, including the author might be problematic when the publisher is trying to manage publicity around an upcoming publication. Again, Crossref is not in a position to resolve this dilemma and we expect that those issuing the mandates will make some reasonable accommodations with publishers who need to manage publicity around publications. In short, “authors” will remain optional metadata.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-summary-and-conclusionsspan\"><span >Summary and conclusions</span></h2>\n<p><span >We were delighted with the response rate on the proposal. It is clear to us that a lot of the respondents really appreciated both being alerted to a set of issues that they were not yet aware of and that they valued the chance to comment on our proposed mechanisms for addressing said issues. We also learned some lessons on how to better structure any such future surveys in order to make them easier for us to summarise and respond to. The wide variety of responses and detailed descriptions of different workflows reconfirmed our sense that Crossref members vary widely in their working practices. We need to continue to work directly with members and understand these different working practices so that we can provide appropriately flexible services to our membership and to the scholarly community in general.</span></p>\n<p><span >Finally, the feedback we received will be used by our product team and our communications &amp; outreach teams to refine our rollout plans for registering content before online availability. We expect that we will rollout this functionality in the second half of 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span >Thanks to those who responded to our RFC.

With this in mind, a group of medical publishers, led by BioMedCentral, approached Crossref to establish a working group, and here, <a href=\"http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2014/01/31/threaded-publications-one-step-closer\" target=\"_blank\">they designed an approach to address this problem:</a> “thread” all the various documents together surrounding a clinical trial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updated-upstream\">Updated upstream</h2>\n<p>To implement threaded publications, publishers extract clinical trial numbers from papers, or ask authors to submit those numbers to them. Publishers add the CTNs to the Crossref DOI metadata via three new fields: clinical trial number, clinical trial registry where trial is registered, and trial stage (pre-results, results or post-results of the trial). Crossref has assigned unique IDs to each trial registry (much the same as we have done for funders in our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry\">Funder Registry</a> and for the same reason - trial registry names and URIs can change over time and we need a persistent identifier). U</span><span >sing a combination of trial registry ID and clinical trial number, we can easily identify other content in the Crossref database that cites the same trial. Finally, Crossref displays the clinical trial metadata on the respective papers for all participating Crossmark publishers. Crossmark is a convenient place for readers to access the clinical trial information and is readily accessible directly from the journal article (online and PDF versions). And of course all of the data also goes into our <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">open API</a> so that anyone can make use of it.</p>\n<p>The reporting of clinical trial results is notoriously inconsistent, something that the <a href=\"http://www.alltrials.net/%22\" target=\"_blank\">AllTrials initiative</a> is also seeking to address. Publishers can help by collecting this information upstream and disseminating it using the existing Crossref infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We ask all publishers to deposit the clinical trial data which is so critical to transparency in this area of research, and have already had the <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.3310/hta191010\" target=\"_blank\">first data</a> in from Crossref member the <a href=\"http://www.nihr.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Health Research</a>. Once we launch the initial set of linked clinical trials, we will expand coverage of the threaded publications to include all content that reports on or references a clinical trial, from protocol to results to supporting data and systematic reviews.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned and watch this space as threaded publications rolls out to journal articles across publishers!</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Crossref & the Art of Cartography: an Open Map for Scholarly Communications","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-the-art-of-cartography-an-open-map-for-scholarly-communications/","published":"Fri, 08 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000","description":"In the 2015 Crossref Annual Meeting, I introduced a metaphor for the work that we do at Crossref.

Publishers register their publications and deposit metadata through a variety of channels (XML, CSV, PDF, manual entry), which we process and transform into Crossref XML for inclusion into our corpus. This data infrastructure which makes possible scholarly communications without restrictions on publisher, subject area, geography, etc. is far more than a reference list, index or directory.</span> </span></p>\n<p><span >If research builds on what came before, one could claim that the process of knowledge production is partly the story of the very relationships between results disseminated (i.e., publications). So let’s consider each publication as a node in a graph where <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/01/Map-entities.jpeg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1247\"><img class=\"wp-image-1250 alignright\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/01/Map-entities-300x237.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"211\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/01/Map-entities-300x237.jpeg 300w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2016/01/Map-entities.jpeg 651w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 211px) 85vw, 211px\" /></a>each has a coordinate and is connected by its citations to other publications (as well those that cite it). Additionally, each is associated with a set of people and places, along with a whole host of elements involved in the research and dissemination process.</span></p>\n<p><span ><span >But take a wider berth, and we begin to capture relationships between all such contributing agents and objects involved in the research process. Here we find an array of entities belonging to the scholarly graph, including different types of research artifacts, publisher and journal, funders, ORCIDs, peer reviews, publication status updates (corrections, retractions, etc.), citations, license information, additional URLs (machine destinations, hosting platforms, etc.), underlying data, software and protocols, materials, discussions and blog posts, recommendations, reference work mentions, etc. The entities on the graph multiply at an even higher rate as researchers share more outputs across more channels. And over time, the graph expands exponentially, producing a webbing that is far more dense and far more vast than we can currently imagine. Perhaps even to the point we realize Borges’ story where a cartographer builds a map so large it replicates the territory itself (</span><em><a href=\"http://www.borges.pitt.edu/node/144\"><span >On Exactitude in Science</span></a></em><span >)!</span></span></p>\n<!--more-->\n<h5 id=\"span-bfrom-graph-to-cartographybspan\"><span ><b>From graph to cartography</b></span></h5>\n<p><span >At the heart of Borges’s poignant story is the map. Crossref’s graph of scholarly communications could be seen in the same light. It has a representational aspect, which is not purely abstract and can be visualized. Here, a map becomes an incredibly potent metaphor. Each link enabled by publisher-deposited metadata is a new street, bridge, or highway that takes us to a particular place (i.e., entity) of interest. These roads lead to articles, researchers, funders, institutions, etc., and in doing so, make them discoverable. They tell a story about the roles of each in the broader research in the landscape dotted with a plethora of places. </span></p>\n<p><span ><span >The scholarly web has a growing corpus of more than </span><a href=\"https://data.crossref.org/reports/statusReport.html\"><span >78 million publications</span></a><span > at this very moment registered with Crossref. On average ten to fifteen thousand new objects appear every day. Maps are all the more essential for getting around in a bewildering environment of new and unfamiliar places, even for known ones in areas of exploding growth. They are critical for orienteering, discovering relationships, identifying sets of associated objects, naming new neighborhoods that emerge (i.e., new research specialties), etc. And if each connection on the map is seen as an event, maps can also represent micro-narratives about the research process and the agents involved. A multi-dimensional map containing all these entities, which serves as an evolving representation of spacetime that is constantly updated and always available, would finally begin to depict the process of scholarly activity as a dynamic, evolving, almost living system.</span></span></p>\n<h5 id=\"span-ban-open-map-for-scholarly-communicationbspan\"><span ><b>An open map for scholarly communication</b></span></h5>\n<p><span ><span >Crossref builds such a scholarly map of the research enterprise and makes it openly available for the entire research ecosystem.

These “events” cover a broad spectrum of online activities including publication usage, links to datasets, social bookmarks, blog mentions, social shares, comments, recommendations, etc. The <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/det-poised-for-launch\">Event Data</a> service collects the data and make it available to all in an open clearinghouse so that data are open, comparable, audit-able, and portable. These data are all publicly available from external platform partners, and they meet the terms of distribution from each partner.</p>\n<p>But Crossref and its members are also concerned about privacy. We recognise that not all data can be made open and public. Particularly if it is sensitive, personally identifiable data about usage. With this in mind, we are also launching an affiliated service, Distributed Usage Logging (DUL), for external parties to transmit sensitive data on user content interactions directly to authorized end points. As researchers are increasingly using “alternative” (non-publisher) platforms to store, access and share literature, publishers are correspondingly  interested in incorporating the activity on their publications into their COUNTER reports.</p>\n<p>Interested third-party sites might include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Institutional and subject repositories</li>\n<li>Aggregator platforms (EBSCOhost, IngentaConnect)</li>\n<li>Researcher-oriented social-networking sites (e.g. Academia.edu, ResearchGate, Mendeley)</li>\n<li>Reading environments and tools (e.g. ReadCube, Utopia Documents)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For publishers to process such events via their COUNTER-compliant usage reporting streams, they need private usage information and a secure channel by which to receive the data from the external platforms. Crossref will provide a switchboard that will enable these non-publisher platforms can safely transmit private data directly to the publisher.</span></p>\n<p><span ><span >The work ahead entails close collaboration between Crossref, <a href=\"http://www.projectcounter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">COUNTER</a>, and the partners who will be sending and receiving the private data. The cross-organizational team will be working towards the following before launch: technical infrastructure development for production service, semantic definition of the usage logging message, assignment and validation of credentials to participants in the scheme, participant integration of the DUL API, and incorporation of this data type into the COUNTER Code of Practice. We will also continue to consult with data privacy and security authorities to ensure that the scheme respects all governmental obligations and community best practice regarding the processing of personal data.</p>\n<p>We will share more about the launch of the service as we make progress along the way.

We help bring together people and metadata in pursuit of an excellent research communications system for all.

Our ‘problem’ was that often people didn’t know Crossref was behind initiatives like CrossCheck, Crossmark and FundRef. Our products had become unlinked from the organisation. And since we’re all about linking things together, that just made no sense.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We needed an icon to give more flexibility across the web that a word mark cannot do alone. The icon is made up of two interlinked angle brackets familiar to those who work with metadata, and can also act as arrows depicting <span style=\"color: #3eb1c8;\">Metadata In</span> and <span style=\"color: #3eb1c8;\">Metadata Out</span>, two themes under which our services can generally be grouped.</span></li>\n<li>Sentence case helps to avoid splitting the word; we do not want to tempt the Cross and the Ref to divide again.

Our own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ORCID_Org/status/647020600192581633\" target=\"_blank\">tweet</a> on the topic was viewed over 10,500 times and retweeted by 60 other accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span >So why all the fuss? We think Auto-Update will transform the way researchers manage their scholarly record.  Until now, researchers have had to manually maintain their record, connecting new activities as they are made public.  In ORCID, that meant using <a href=\"https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973653-Add-works-by-direct-import-from-other-systems\" target=\"_blank\">Search &amp; Link tools</a> developed by our member organizations to claim works manually.  Researchers frequently ask,  “Why, if I include my ORCID iD when I submit a manuscript or dataset, isn’t my ORCID record “automagically” updated when the work is published?”</span></p>\n<p><span >With the launch of Auto-Update, that is just what will happen. </span></p>\n<p><strong>It might seem like magic but there are a few steps to make it work:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Researchers.</strong> <span >You need to do two things:  (1) use your ORCID iD when submitting a paper or dataset, and (2) <a href=\"https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973653-Add-works-by-direct-import-from-other-systems\" target=\"_blank\">authorize Crossref and DataCite to update your ORCID record</a>.   In keeping with <a href=\"https://orcid.org/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\">our commitment to ensuring that researchers maintain full control of their ORCID record</a>, you may revoke this permission at any time, and may also choose privacy settings for the information posted on your record.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Publishers and data centers.</strong> These organizations also have two things to do: (1) collect ORCID identifiers during the submission workflow, using a process that involves authentication (not a type-in field!), and (2) embed the iD in the published paper and include the iD when submitting information to Crossref or DataCite.  </p>\n<p><strong>Crossref and DataCite.</strong> Upon receipt of data from a publisher or data center with a valid identifier, Crossref or DataCite can automatically push that information to the researcher’s ORCID record.  </p>\n<p><span >More information about how to opt out of this service can be found here: <a href=\"https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953-ORCID-inbox-notifications-and-frequency-settings\" target=\"_blank\">the ORCID Inbox</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px\">\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/ORCID-graphic-223x300.png\" width=\"350\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><span >Why is this so revolutionary? </span></p>\n<p>A bit of background, first. Crossref and DataCite, both non-profit organizations, are leaders in minting DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) for research publications and datasets.  A <a href=\"http://www.crossref.org/01company/16fastfacts.html#sthash.o7NGwOnP.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\">DOI</a> is a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a digital object – in this case, an electronic journal article, book chapter, or a dataset. Each DOI is associated with a set of basic metadata and a URL pointer to the full text, so that it uniquely identifies the content item and provides a persistent link to its location on the internet.</p>\n<p><span >Crossref, working with over a thousand scholarly publishers, has generated well over 75 million DOIs for journal articles and book chapters.  DataCite works with nearly 600 data centers worldwide and has generated over 6.5 million DOIs to date. Between them, Crossref and DataCite have already received almost a half a million works from publishers and data centers that include an ORCID iD validated by the author/contributor.  With Auto-Update functionality in place, information about these articles can transit (with the author’s permission) to the author’s ORCID record. </span></p>\n<p><span >Auto-Update doesn’t stop at a researcher’s ORCID record.  Systems that have integrated ORCID APIs and have a researcher’s ORCID record connected to that system — their faculty profile system, library repository, webpage, funder reporting system — can receive alerts from ORCID.  Information can move easily and unambiguously across systems. </span></p>\n<p><span >This is the beginning of the end for the endless rekeying of information that plagues researchers — and anyone involved in research reporting.  Surely something to celebrate!</span></p>\n<p><span >Questions you may have:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q. What do I need to do to sign up for auto-update?</strong></p>\n<p><span >You need to grant permission to Crossref and DataCite to post information to your ORCID record.  You can do this today by using the Search and Link wizard for DataCite available through the ORCID Registry or the DataCite <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20151123212630/http://search.labs.datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata Search page</a>.  We also have added a new ORCID Inbox, so that you can receive a message from Crossref or DataCite if they receive a datafile with your iD, and you can grant permission directly. See <a href=\"https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953-ORCID-inbox-notifications-and-frequency-settings\" target=\"_blank\">More on the ORCID Inbox</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Will Crossref and DataCite be able to update my ORCID record with already published works for which I did not use my ORCID iD?</strong></p>\n<p><span >No.  The auto-update process only applies to those works that these organizations receive that include your ORCID iD. For previous works that did not include your ORCID iD, you will need to use the DataCite and Crossref Search and Link wizards to connect information with your iD.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q. What information will be posted to my record?</strong></p>\n<p><span >With your permission, basic information about the article (such as title, list of contributors, journal or publisher) or dataset (such as data center name and date of publication) will be posted, along with a DOI that allows users to navigate to the source paper or dataset landing page.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q.

A dump of <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10289220\">all the submissions to Reddit since 2006</a>. “How many of those are DOIs?”, I thought. Reddit is a very broad community, but has some very interesting parts, including some great science communication. How much are DOIs used in Reddit?</span></p>\n<p><span >(There has since been a <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10309581\">discussion about this blog post</a> on Hacker News)</span></p>\n<p><span >We have a whole <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/event-data\">strategy for DOI Event Tracking</a>, but nothing beats a quick hack or is more irresistible than a data dump.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"span-what-is-a-doispan\"><span >What is a DOI?</span></h1>\n<p><span >If you know what a DOI is, skip this! The DOI system (Digital Object Identifier) is a link redirection service. When a publisher puts some content online they could just hand out the URL. But the URL can change, and within a very short space of time, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\">link-rot</a> happens. DOIs are designed to fight link rot. When a publisher mints a DOI to an article they just published, they can change the article’s URL and then update the DOI to point to the new place. DOIs are persistent. They are URLs. They’re also identifiers (kind of like ISBNs), and they’re used in scholarly publishing as to do citations.</span></p>\n<p><span >Crossref is the DOI registration agency for scholarly publishing. That means mostly things like journal articles. There are other registration agencies, for example, DataCite, who do DOIs for research datasets. But at this point in time, most DOIs are Crossref’s.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"span-what-does-finding-dois-in-reddit-meanspan\"><span >What does finding DOIs in Reddit mean?</span></h1>\n<p><span >It means someone used a DOI to cite something! DOIs can be used for any kind of content, but because of the sheer volume of scientific publishing, lots of DOIs are for science. Having a DOI doesn’t say anything about quality or content. But it does indicate that the person who created the DOI probably intended it to be cited. We care because it means that every time a DOI is used a tiny bit of link-rot doesn’t have the opportunity to take hold. Every time something is discussed on Reddit and the DOI is used, it means that archaeologists using the data dump in 100 years will have identifiers to find the things being discussed, even if the web and URLs have long since crumbled to dust.</span></p>\n<p><span >Or, more likely, in five year’s time when a few URLs will have shuffled around.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"span-the-resultsspan\"><span >The results</span></h1>\n<p><span >DOIs have been used on Reddit since 2008 (the logs start in 2006).

But let’s be honest, it’s not a massive amount.</span></p>\n<p><span >We have a list of domains that our DOIs point to. They mostly belong to publishers, so every time we see a link to a domain on the list, there’s a chance (not a certainty) that the link could have been made using a DOI. We found a large number of these, orders of magnitude more than DOIs.

Crossref represents over 5000 scholarly publishers and many of them ask authors for their ORCID iD and include it in the publication information they send us. Also it will mean less manual searching and adding; you’ve always been able to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131229210637/http://search.crossref.org/\">search crossref metadata</a> for your name and/or publications and manually add them to your ORCID record, this auto-update simply means that when your publishers include the info we can update and add work(s) to your ORCID record automatically for you. You can still choose to hide/show whatever works you choose, and, of course, you’ll have the opportunity to authorize or switch off the integration completely (though future publications may trigger a new request). Overall, you’ll benefit from a more complete and up-to-date ORCID record to showcase your work.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>What this means for publishers</strong></span></p>\n<p><span >If you’re one of the 230 Crossref publishers who already supply ORCID iDs along with the usual metadata submissions, then you’re all good. If you don’t offer this yet, you might want to think about starting - it’s beneficial for funders, publishers, other researchers, libraries, and universities to be able to integrate with complete researcher records. You can ask for ORCIDs upon manuscript submission or acceptance and tag it in your metadata deposits with Crossref. We’ll ensure the rest.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Various caveats and important details to be aware of</strong></span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span >Apparently not all publishers are members of Crossref (we know, crazy), and in addition only a subset of Crossref publishers (230 in total) are asking authors for ORCID iDs and/or including them in their metadata deposits.</span></li>\n<li><span >Some publishers may choose to opt out of passing through the details to ORCID using the Crossref auto-update (perhaps they plan to send this directly at some point) but if you’ve included your ORCID with your submission and it isn’t automatically updated, then check with your publisher.</span></li>\n<li><span >We have a “backlog” of almost 250,000 DOIs that include ORCID iDs so that may mean we do some bulk updates at a later date where authors will receive an email with a long list of works to add.

Following a successful <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-doi-event-tracker-pilot/\">pilot run</a> started Spring 2014, the service has been approved to move toward production and is expected to launch in 2016. Any party wishing to join this phase is welcome to contact Jennifer Lin. The DOI Event Tracker (DET) registers a wide variety of events such as bookmarks, comments, social shares, citations, and links to other research entities, from a growing list of online sources. DET aggregates them, and stores and delivers the data in many ways.</span></p>\n<p><span ><strong>Open, portable, and licensed for maximum reuse</strong></span></p>\n<p><span >Crossref has long served as the citation linking and metadata infrastructure provider for scholarly communication; the new DOI Event Tracker is a natural next step, providing a practical solution as a resource for the whole community. The tracker offers the following features:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Data on event activity across a common pool of online channels.</span></li>\n<li><span >Near real-time alerting for select sources with push notifications to the system.</span></li>\n<li><span >Cross-publisher monitoring to enable benchmarking and provide context to the data.</span></li>\n<li><span >Common format for normalizing data results across the diverse set of sources via modern REST API.</span></li>\n<li><span >Secure and regularly refreshed backups of critical data for long term data preservation.</span></li>\n<li><span >Transparency of data collection so as to ensure auditable, replicable, and trustworthy results.</span></li>\n<li><span >Query-initiated retrieval or real-time alerts when an event of interest occurs.</span></li>\n<li><span >CC-0 license for open and flexible propagation of data.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >A number of platforms are already confirmed and more parties are welcomed at any stage. So far we have confirmation to track DOI events on the following platforms:</span></p>\n<p><span >[table id=1 /]</span></p>\n<p><span >This set of sources reflects our initial focus on parties willing to allow their data to be redistributed in the common pool. Efforts are underway to expand the source list to include <a href=\"http://twitter.com\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mysciencework.com/\">MyScienceWork</a>, among others. Publishers can also act as sources by publishing and distributing DOI event data via the DET when an event occurs on its platform (for example, when a PDF is downloaded, or when a comment mentions a DOI in a locally hosted discussion forum, etc.). This would make local DOI activity globally available to funders, researchers, institutions, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span >DET provides benefits of scale and ease of access as a central point for collecting and propagating data to the community. As a single point of access, it overcomes the business and technical hurdles that are a part of managing multiple online sources where scholarly activity occurs, in a rapidly changing landscape of online channels. This resource covers content across publishers and serves as a strong foundation to support the development of tools and services by any party. DET users will always be able to combine the DET data with those individually collected via negotiated or paid access. DET remains a utility separate from any value-added amenities, such as analytics, presentation, and reporting.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-det-service-level-agreementspan\"><span >DET Service-Level Agreement</span></h2>\n<p><span >For those who seek the highest level of service and a more flexible range of access options, Crossref will provide a Service-Level Agreement (SLA) service for the DOI Event Tracker. The DET SLA includes the following additional features on top of the common data offering:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Access to the complete suite of sources, which includes restricted and/or paid sources in addition to common data, providing the fullest picture of DOI usage activity possible.</span></li>\n<li><span >Guaranteed uptime and response time to the latest raw data on the aggregate activity surrounding a DOI.</span></li>\n<li><span >Guaranteed support response time to questions and issues surrounding data and data delivery.</span></li>\n<li><span >Flexible data access options: on-demand real time data access and scheduled bulk downloads for processing batch analytics.</span></li>\n<li><span >Optimum retrieval rates and accelerated delivery speeds with the dedicated SLA API.</span></li>\n<li><span >Access to a webhook API for events of interest as an alternative to polling DET.</span></li>\n<li><span >Standardized and enhanced linkback service for the difficult-to-track, grey literature.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >The DET SLA service has a simple, value-based pricing model based on subscriber size. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/crossref.org/forms/d/1_pOnL6500eFebismbHMlAJINxVFqvDFMMkupZualmNo/viewform?usp=send_form\">Register your interest</a> in Crossref’s DOI Event Tracker and the DET SLA service if you would like stay informed of the upcoming launch.

The funding data comprises funder name and identifier, and grant number or numbers. Funding data can be deposited on its own or with the rest of the metadata for an item of content.</p>\n<p>There are two ways that publishers can collect this funding information for any given piece of content: by asking authors to input the funder name(s) and award number(s) via their submission system, or extracting the funder names and award numbers from the acknowledgements in the paper.</p>\n<p>The funding data is only useful if it is standardised, and so it is absolutely critical that funder names are deposited with their associated funder IDs from the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\" target=\"_blank\">Funder Registry</a>.</p>\n<p>For publishers considering or about to start collecting and depositing funding data, and for those already doing so, we have drawn up some guidelines that will help you to ensure good quality metadata.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are collecting funding information from authors via your submission system:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide very clear instructions for your authors. Your submission system should prompt the author towards the canonical name from Crossref’s Funder Registry as they type, or guide them through a pick-list. Make it clear to authors that they should choose funder names from this list and not copy and paste from their manuscript.</li>\n<li>Work with your submission system vendor or adapt your in-house system to make it easy for authors to select from the Funder Registry, and more difficult to paste incorrect names or ignore the suggested names. Consider a warning message if an unknown name is entered, and offer a list of close matches.</li>\n<li>Instruct authors to look for the name of the funding body rather than a specific program or project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you or one of your vendors is extracting funding information from papers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide the same clear instructions to your vendor(s). Stress the importance of matching the funder names in the acknowledgements to the names in the Funder Registry.</li>\n<li>Look for common text-extraction errors such as concatenated funder names, punctuation errors, and stop words such as “of/for” that are commonly used interchangeably, or the presence or absence of “the” at the start of a funder name.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For both workflows:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add QA into your workflow. Many of the names sent to Crossref without IDs are very obviously funders that are in the Registry, and a check by editorial or production staff could correct misspellings or fill in blanks. Check that grant numbers have been separated and are not being deposited as one long string.</li>\n<li>Be aware that funder names deposited without IDs are not valid funding data and will be hidden from Crossref’s search tools and APIs until such time as they are updated with a funder ID.</li>\n<li>The funding data section of a deposit (but not the rest of the deposit) will be rejected by the Crossref deposit system if\n<ul>\n<li>The funder_name field contains a numerical string longer than 4 digits</li>\n<li>The funder_id field contains a number that is not an ID from the Funder Registry</li>\n<li>The funder_name contains text that exceeds 200 characters</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consider only depositing data that has funder IDs and holding the rest to re-poll against the Funder Registry at a later date when more funder names have been added.

After all, <a href=\"http://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/\" target=\"_blank\">the best thing a mission-driven membership organisation could do for its members would be to fulfil its mission and put itself out of business</a>. If we could come up with a technical fix that didn’t require the social component, it would save our members a lot of money and effort.</p>\n<p>When one of these ideas is posed, there is a brief flurry of activity as another generation goes through the same thought processes and (so far) comes to the same conclusions.</p>\n<p>The proposals I’ve seen generally fall into one of the following groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace persistent identifiers (PIDs) with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\" target=\"_blank\">hashes</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum\" target=\"_blank\">checksums</a>, etc.</li>\n<li>Just use search (often, but not always coupled with 1 above)</li>\n<li>Automagically create PIDs out of metadata.</li>\n<li>Automagically redirect broken citations to archived versions of the content identified</li>\n<li>And more recently… use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I thought it might help advance the discussion and avoid a bunch of dead ends if I summarised (rehashed?) some of the issues that should be considered when exploring these options.</p>\n<p>Warning: Refers to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records\" target=\"_blank\">FRBR</a> terminology. Those of a sensitive disposition might want to turn away now.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DOIs, PMIDs, etc. and other persistent identifiers are primarily used by our community as “citation identifiers”. We generally cite at the “expression” level.</li>\n<li>Consider the difference between how a “citation identifier” a “work identifier” and a “content verification identifier” might function.</li>\n<li>How do you deal with “equivalent manifestations” of the same expression. For example the ePub, PDF and HTML representations of the same article are intellectually equivalent and interchangeable when citing. The same applies to csv &amp; tsv representations of the same dataset. So, for example, how do hashes work here as a citation identifier?</li>\n<li>Content can be changed in ways that typically doesn’t effect the interpretation or crediting of the work. For example, by reformatting, correcting spelling, etc. In these cases the copies should share the same citation identifier, but the hashes will be different.</li>\n<li>Content that is virtually identical (and shares the same hash) might be republished in different venues (e.g. a normal issue and a thematic issue). Context in citation is important. How do you point somebody at the copy in the correct context?</li>\n<li>Some copies of an article or dataset are stewarded by publishers. That is, if there is an update, errata, corrigenda, retraction/withdrawal, they can reflect that on the stewarded copy, not on copies they don’t host or control. Location is, in fact, important here.</li>\n<li>Some copies of content will be nearly identical, but will differ in ways that would affect the interpretation and/or crediting of the work. A corrected number in a table for example. How would you create a citation form a search that would differentiate the correct version from the incorrect version?</li>\n<li>Some content might be restricted, private or under embargo. For example private patient data, sensitive data about archaeological finds or the migratory patterns of endangered animals.</li>\n<li>Some content is behind paywalls (cue jeremiads)</li>\n<li>Content is increasingly composed of static and dynamic elements. How do you identify the parts that can be hashed?</li>\n<li>How do you create an identifier out of metadata and not have them look like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Item_and_Contribution_Identifier\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This list is a starting point that should allow people to avoid a lot of blind alleys.</p>\n<p>In the mean time, good luck to those seeking alternatives to the current crop of persistent citation identifier systems. I’m not convinced it is possible to replace them, but if it is- I hope I beat you to it. 🙂 And I hope I can avoid stabbing myself in the eye.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Coming to you Live from Wikipedia","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/coming-to-you-live-from-wikipedia/","published":"Wed, 20 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000","description":"We’ve been collecting citation events from Wikipedia for some time.

The system was never completely down, but for at least part of the subsequent 48 hours, up to 50% of DOI resolution traffic was effectively broken. This was true for almost all DOI registration agencies, including Crossref, <a href=\"http://www.datacite.org\">DataCite</a> and <a href=\"http://www.medra.org\">mEDRA</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span >At the time we kept people updated on what we knew via Twitter, mailing lists and our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/problems-with-dx.doi.org-on-january-20th-2015-what-we-know./\">technical blog at CrossTech</a>. We also promised that, once we’d done a thorough investigation, we’d report back. Well, we haven’t finished investigating all implications of the outage. There are both substantial technical and governance issues to investigate. But last week we provided a preliminary report to the Crossref board on the basic technical issues, and we thought we’d share that publicly now.</p>\n</span>\n<h2 id=\"span-the-gory-detailsspan\"><span >The Gory Details</span></h2>\n<p><span >First, the outage of January 20th was not caused by a software or hardware failure, but was instead due to an administrative error at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). The domain name “doi.org” is managed by CNRI on behalf of the International DOI Foundation (IDF). The domain name was not on “auto-renew” and CNRI staff simply forgot to manually renew the domain. Once the domain name was renewed, it took about 48 hours for the fix to propagate through the DNS system and for the DOI resolution service to return to normal. Working with CNRI we analysed traffic through the Handle HTTP proxy and here’s the graph:</span><figure id=\"attachment_537\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-537\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/doi_outage_impact.jpeg\" alt=\"Chart of Handle HTTP proxy traffic during outage\" width=\"800\" height=\"545\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/doi_outage_impact.jpeg 800w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/doi_outage_impact-300x204.jpeg 300w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/doi_outage_impact-624x425.jpeg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The above graph shows traffic over a 24 hour period on each day from January 12, 2015 through February 10th, 2015. The heavy blue line for January 20th and the heavy red line for January 21st show how referrals declined as the doi.org domain was first deleted, and then added back to DNS.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span >It could have been much worse. The domain registrar (GoDaddy) at least had a “<a href=\"https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/609/can-i-renew-my-domain-name-after-it-expires\">renewal grace and registry redemption period</a>” which meant that even though CNRI forgot to pay its bill to renew the domain, the domain was simply “parked” and could easily be renewed by them. This is the standard setting for GoDaddy. Cheaper domain registrars might not include this kind of protection by default. Had there been no grace period, then it would have been possible for somebody other than CNRI to quickly buy the domain name as soon as it expired. There are many automated processes which search for and register recently expired domain names. Had this happened, at the very least it would have been expensive for CNRI to buy the domain back. The interruption to DOI resolutions during this period would have also been almost complete.</span></p>\n<p><span >So we got off relatively easy. The domain name is now on auto-renew. The outage was not as bad as it could have been. It was addressed quickly and we can be reasonably confident that the same administrative error will not happen again. Crossref even managed to garner some public praise for the way in which we handled the outage. It is tempting to heave a sigh of relief and move on.</span></p>\n<p><span >We also know that everybody involved at CNRI, the IDF and Crossref have felt truly dreadful about what happened. So it is also tempting to not re-open old wounds.</span></p>\n<p><span >But it would be a mistake if we did not examine a fundamental strategic issue that this partial outage has raised: How can Crossref claim that its DOIs are ‘persistent’ if Crossref does not control some of the key infrastructure on which it depends? What can we do to address these dependencies?</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-what-do-we-mean-by-persistentspanfigure-idattachment_540--classwp-caption-alignnone\"><span >What do we mean by “persistent?”</span><figure id=\"attachment_540\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"></h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-540\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image02.png\" alt=\"@kaythaney tweets on definition of &quot;persistent&quot;\" width=\"542\" height=\"66\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image02.png 542w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image02-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 542px) 85vw, 542px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></span> <span >@kaythaney tweets on definition of “persistent”</span></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span >To start with, we should probably explore what we mean by ‘persistent’. We use the word “persistent” or “persistence” about 470 times on the Crossref web site. The word “persistent” appears central to our image of ourselves and of the services that we provide. We describe our core, mandatory service as the “Crossref Persistent Citation Infrastructure.”</span></p>\n<p><span >The primary sense of the word “persistent” in the New Oxford American Dictionary is:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >Continuing firmly or obstinately in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >We play on this sense of the word as a synonym for “stubborn” when we half-jokingly say that, “Crossref DOIs are as persistent as Crossref staff.” Underlying this joke is a truth, which is that persistence is primarily a social issue, not a technical issue.</span></p>\n<p><span >Yet presumably we once chose to use the word “persistent” instead of “perpetual” or “permanent” for other reasons. “Persistence” implies longevity, without committing to “forever.” Scholarly publishers, perhaps more than most industries, understand the long term. After all, the scholarly record dates back to at least 1665 and we know that the scholarly community values even our oldest journal backfiles. By using the word “persistent” as opposed to the more emphatic “permanent” we are essentially acknowledging that we, as an industry, understand the complexity and expense of stewarding the content for even a few hundred years to say nothing of “forever.” Only the chronologically naïve would recklessly coin terms like “permalink” for standard HTTP links which have a documented half-life of well under a decade.</span></p>\n<p><span >So “persistent” implies longevity- without committing to forever- but this still begs questions. What time span is long enough to qualify as “persistent?” What, in particular, do we mean by “persistent” when we talk about Crossref’s “Persistent Citation Infrastructure?” or of Crossref DOIs being “persistent identifiers?”</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-what-do-we-mean-by-persistent-identifiersspanfigure-idattachment_541--classwp-caption-alignnone\"><span >What do we mean by “persistent identifiers?”</span><figure id=\"attachment_541\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"></h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-541\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image03.png\" alt=\"@violetailik tweets on outage and implication for term &quot;persistent identifier&quot;\" width=\"543\" height=\"64\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image03.png 543w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image03-300x35.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 543px) 85vw, 543px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></span> <span >]<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image03.png\">5</a> @violetailik tweets on outage and implication for term “persistent identifier”</span></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span >First, we often make the mistake of talking about “persistent identifiers” as if there is some technical magic that makes them continue working when things like HTTP URIs break. The very term “persistent identifier” encourages this kind of magical thinking and, ideally, we would instead talk about “persist-able” identifiers. That is, those that have some form of indirection built into them. There are many technologies that do this- Handles, DOIs, Purls, ARKs and every URL shortener in existence. Each of them simply introduces a pointer mapping between an identifier and location where a resource or content resides. This mapping can be updated when the content moves, thus preserving the link. Of course, just because an identifier is persist-able doesn’t mean it is persistent. If Purls or DOIs are not updated when content moves, then they are no more persistent than normal URLs.</span></p>\n<p><span ><a href=\"http://andrew.treloar.net/\">Andrew Treloar</a> points out that when we talk about “persistent identifiers,” we tend to conflate several things:</span></p>\n<ol >\n<li>\n<span >The persistence of the identifier- that is the token or string itself.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span >The persistence of the thing being pointed at by the identifier. For example, the content.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span >The persistence of the mapping of the identifier to the thing being identified.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span >The persistence of the resolver that allows one to follow the mapping of the identifier to the thing being identified.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span >The persistence of a mechanism for updating the mapping of the identifier to the thing being identified.</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span >If any of the above fails, then “persistence” fails. This is probably why we tend to conflate them in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><span >Each of these aspects of “persistence” is worthy of much closer scrutiny, however, in the most recent case of the January outage of “doi.org,” the problem specifically occurred with item “D”- the persistence of the resolver. When CNRI failed to renew the domain name for “doi.org” on time, the DOI resolver was rendered unavailable to a large percentage of people over a period of about 48 hours as global DNS servers first removed, and then added back the “doi.org” domain.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-turtles-all-the-way-downa-hrefhttpenwikipediaorgwikiturtles_all_the_way_downaspan\"><span >Turtles all the way down<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down\">*</a></span></h2>\n<p><span >The initial public reaction to the outage was, almost unanimous in one respect- people assumed that the problem originated with Crossref.</span><figure id=\"attachment_544\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-544\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image06.png\" alt=\"@iainh_z tweets to Crossref enquiring about failed DOI resoluton\" width=\"543\" height=\"69\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image06.png 543w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image06-300x38.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 543px) 85vw, 543px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></span> <span >@iainh_z tweets to Crossref enquiring about failed DOI resoluton</span></figcaption></figure> <figure id=\"attachment_543\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-543\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image05.png\" alt=\"@LibSkrat tweets at Crossref about DOI outage\" width=\"540\" height=\"65\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image05.png 540w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image05-300x36.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 85vw, 540px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></span> <span >@LibSkrat tweets at Crossref about DOI outage</span></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span >This is both surprising and unsurprising. It is surprising because we have fairly recent data indicating that lots of people recognise the DOI brand, but not the Crossref brand. Chances are, that this relatively superficial “brand” awareness does not correlate with understanding how the system works or how it relates to persistence. It is likely plenty of people clicked on DOIs at the time of the outage and, when they didn’t work, simply shrugged or cursed under their breath. They were aware of the term ‘DOI’ but not of the promise of “persistence”. Hence, they did not take to twitter to complain about it, and if they did, they probably wouldn’t have known who to complain to or even how to complain to them (neither CNRI or the IDF has a Twitter account).</span></p>\n<p><span >But the focus on Crossref is also unsurprising. Crossref is by far the largest and most visible DOI Registration Agency. Many otherwise knowledgeable people in the industry simply don’t know that there are even other RAs.</span></p>\n<p><span >They also generally didn’t know of the strategic dependencies that exist in the Crossref system. By “strategic dependencies” we are not talking about the vendors, equipment and services that virtually every online enterprise depends on. These kinds of services are largely fungible. Their failures may be inconvenient and even dramatic, but they are rarely existential.</span></p>\n<p><span >Instead we are talking about dependencies that underpin Crossref’s ability to deliver on its mission. Dependencies that not only affect Crossref’s operations, but also its ability to self-govern and meet the needs of its membership. In this case there are three major dependencies: Two of which are specific to Crossref and other DOI registration agencies and one which is shared by virtually all online enterprises today. The organizations are: The International DOI Foundation (IDF), Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).</span><figure id=\"attachment_545\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-545\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image07.png\" alt=\"Dependency of RAs on IDF, CNRI and ICANN.

Turtles all the way down.</span></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span >Each of these agencies has technology, governance and policy impacts on Crossref and the other DOI registration agencies, but here we will focus on the technological dependencies.</span></p>\n<p><span >At the top of the diagram are a subset of the various DOI Registration Agencies. Each RA uses the DOI for a particular constituency (e.g. scholarly publishers) and application (e.g. citation). Sometimes these constituencies/applications overlap (as with mEDRA, Crossref and DataCite), but sometimes they are orthogonal to the other RAs, as is the case with EIDR. All, however, are members of the IDF.</span></p>\n<p><span >The IDF sets technical policies and development agendas for the DOI infrastructure. This includes recommendations about how RAs should display and link DOIs. Of course all of these decisions have an impact on the RAs. However, the IDF provides little technical infrastructure of its own as it has no full-time staff. Instead it outsources the operation of the system to CNRI, this includes the management of the doi.org domain which the IDF owns.</span></p>\n<p><span >The actual DOI infrastructure is hosted on a platform called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_System\">Handle System</a> which was developed by and is currently run by CNRI. The Handle System is part of a quite complex and sophisticated platform for managing digital objects that was originally developed for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA\">DARPA</a>. A subset of the Handle system is designated for use by DOIs and is identified by the “10” prefix (e.g. 10.5555/12345678). The Handle system itself is not based on HTTP (the web protocol). Indeed, one of the much touted features of the Handle System is that it isn’t based on any specific resolution technology. This was seen as a great virtue in the late 1990s when the DOI system was developed and the internet had just witnessed an explosion of seemingly transient, competing protocols (e.g. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29\">Gopher</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_information_server\">WAIS</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_search_engine\">Archie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mprove.de/diplom/text/2.1.15_hyperg.html\">HyperWave/Hyper-G</a>, HTTP, etc.). But what looked like a wild-west of protocols quickly settled into an HTTP hegemony. In practice, virtually all DOI interactions with the Handle system are via HTTP and so, in order to interact with the web, the Handle System employs a “Handle proxy” which translates back and forth between HTTP, and the native Handle system. This all may sound complicated, and the backend of the Handle system is really very sophisticated, but it turns out that the DOI really uses only a fraction of the Handle system’s features. In fact, the vast majority of DOI interactions merely use the Handle system as a giant lookup table which allows one to translate an identifier into a web location. For example, it will take a DOI Handle like this:</span></p>\n<pre><span >10.5555/12345678</span></pre>\n<p><span >and redirect it to (as of this writing) the following URL:</span></p>\n<pre><span >http://psychoceramics.labs.crossref.org/10.5555-12345678.html</span></pre>\n<p><span >This whole transformation is normally never seen by a user. It is handled transparently by the web browser, which does the lookup and redirection in the background using HTTP and talking to the Handle Proxy. In the late 1990s, even doing this simple translation quickly, at scale with a robust distributed infrastructure, was not easy. These days however we see dozens if not hundreds of “URL Shorteners” doing exactly the same thing at far greater scale than the Handle System.</span></p>\n<p><span >It may seem a shame that more of the Handle Systems features are not used, but the truth is the much touted platform independence of the Handle System rapidly became more of a liability and impediment to persistence than an aid. To be blunt, if in X years a new technology comes out that supersedes the web, what do we think the societal priority is going to be?</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >To provide a robust and transparent transition from the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/squillion\">squillions</a> of existing HTTP URI identifiers that the entire world depends on?</span></li>\n<li><span >To provide a robust and transparent transition from the tiny subset of Handle-based identifiers that are used by about a hundred million specialist resources?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >Quite simply, the more the Handle/DOI systems diverge from common web protocols and practice, then the more we will jeopardise the longevity of our so-called persistent identifiers.</span></p>\n<p><span >So, in the end, DOI registration agencies really only use the Handle system for translating web addresses. All of the other services and features one might associate with DOIs (reference resolution, metadata lookup, content negotiation, OAI-PMH, REST APIs, Crossmark, CrossCheck, TDM Services, FundRef etc) are all provided at the RA level.</span></p>\n<p><span >But this address resolution is still critical. And it is exactly what failed for many users on January 20th 2015. And to be clear, it wasn’t the robust and scaleable Handle System that failed. It wasn’t the Handle Proxy that failed. And it certainly wasn’t any RA-controlled technology that failed. These systems were all up and running. What happened was that the standard handle proxy that the IDF recommends RAs use, “dx.doi.org”, was effectively rendered invisible to wide portions the internet because the “doi.org” domain was not renewed. This underscores two important points.</span></p>\n<p><span >The first is that it doesn’t much matter what precisely caused the outage. In this case it was an administrative error. But the effect would have been similar if the Handle proxies had failed of if the Handle system itself had somehow collapsed. In the end, Crossref and all DOI registration agencies are existentially dependent on the Handle system running and being accessible.</span></p>\n<p><span >The second is that the entire chain of dependencies from the RAs down through CNRI are also dependent on the DNS system which, in turn, is governed by ICANN. We should really not be making too much of the purported technology independence of the DOI and Handle systems. To be fair, this limitation is inherent to all persistent identifier schemes that aim to work with the web. It really is “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down\">turtles all the way down.</a>”</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-what-didnt-fail-on-january-19th20th-and-whyspan\"><span >What didn’t fail on January 19th/20th and why?</span></h2>\n<p><span >You may have noticed a lot of hedging in our description of the outage of January 19th/20th. For one thing, we use the term “rolling outage.” Access to the Handle Proxy via “dx.doi.org” was never completely unavailable during the period. As we’ve explained, this is because the error was discovered very quickly and the domain was renewed hours after it expired. The nature of DNS propagation meant that even as some DNS servers were deleting the “doi.org” entry, others were adding it back to their tables. In some ways this was really confusing because it meant it was difficult to predict where the system was working and where it wasn’t. Ultimately it all stabilised after the standard 48-hour DNS propagation cycle.</span></p>\n<p><span >But there were also some Handle-based services that simply were not affected at all by the outage. During the outage, a few people asked us if there was an alternative way to resolve DOIs. The answer was “yes,” there were several. It turns out that “doi.org” is not the only DNS name that points to the Handle Proxy. People could easily substitute “dx.doi.org” with “dx.crossref.org” or “dx.medra.org” or “hdl.handle.net” and “resolve” any DOI. Many of Crossref’s internal services use these internal names and so the services continued to work. This is partly why we only discovered the “doi.org” was down from people reporting it on Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span >And, of course, there were other services that were not affected by the outage. Crossmark, the REST API, and Crossref Metadata Search all continued to work during the outage.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-protecting-ourselvesspan\"><span >Protecting ourselves</span></h2>\n<p><span >So what can we do to reduce our dependencies and/or the risks intrinsic to those dependencies?</span></p>\n<p><span >Obviously, the simplest way to have avoided the outage would have been to ensure that the “doi.org” domain was set to automatically renew. That’s been done. Is there anything else we should do? A few ideas have been floated that might allow us to provide even more resilience. They range greatly in complexity and involvement.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span >Provide well-publicised public status dashboards that show what systems are up and which clearly map dependencies so that people could, for instance, see that the doi.org server was not visible to systems that depended on it. Of course, if such a dashboard had been hosted at doi.org, nobody would have been able to connect to it. Stoopid turtles.</span></li>\n<li><span >Encourage DOI RAs to have the members point to Handle proxies using domain names under the RA’s control. Simply put, if Crossref members had been using “dx.crossref.org” instead of “dx.doi.org”, then Crossref DOIs would have continued to work throughout the outage of “doi.org”. The same with mEDRA, and the other RAs. This way each RA would have control over another critical piece of their infrastructure. It would also mean that if any single RA made a similar domain name renewal mistake, the impact would be isolated to a particular constituency. Finally, using RA-specific domains for resolving DOIs might also make it clear that different DOIs are managed by different RAs and might have different services associated with them. Perhaps Crossref would spend less time supporting non-Crossref DOIs?</span></li>\n<li><span >Provide a parallel, backup resolution technology that could be pointed to in the event of a catastrophic Handle System failure. For example we could run a parallel system based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator\">PURLs</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archival_Resource_Key\">ARKs</a> or another persist-able identifier infrastructure.</span></li>\n<li><span >Explore working with ICANN to get the handle resolvers moved under the special “.arpa” top level domain (TLD). This TLD (<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3172\">RFC 3172</a>) is reserved for services that are considered to be “critical to the operation of the internet.” This is an option that was first discussed at <a href=\"http://www.circleid.com/posts/20111215_providing_persistent_domain_names_under_arpa/\">a meeting of persistent identifier providers in 2011</a>.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span >These are all tactical approaches to addressing the specific technical problem of the Handle System becoming unavailable, but they do not address deeper issues relating to our strategic dependence on several third parties. Even though the IDF and CNRI provide us with pretty simple and limited functionality, that functionality is critical to our operations and our claim to be providing persistent identifiers. Yet these technologies are not in our direct control. We had to scramble to get hold of people to fix the problem. For a while, we were not able to tell our users or members what was happening because we did not know ourselves.</span></p>\n<p><span >The irony is that <em>Crossref</em> was held to account, and we were in the firing line the entire time. Again, this was almost unavoidable. In addition to being the largest DOI RA, we are also the only RA that has any significant social media presence and support resources. Still, it meant that we were the public face of the outage while the IDF and CNRI remained in the background.</span></p>\n<p><span >And this is partly why our board has encouraged us to investigate another option:</span></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<span >Explore what it would take to remove Crossref dependencies on the IDF and CNRI.</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span >Crossref is just part of a chain of dependencies the goes from our members down through the IDF, CNRI and, ultimately, ICANN. Our claim to providing a persistent identifier structure depends entirely on the IDF and CNRI. Here we have explored some of the technical dependencies. But there are also complex governance and policy implications of these dependencies. Each organization has membership rules, guidelines and governance structures which can impact Crossref members. Indeed, the IDF and CNRI are themselves members of groups (ISO and DONA, respectively) which might ultimately have policy or governance impact for DOI registration agencies. We will need to understand the strategic implications of these non technical dependencies as well.</span></p>\n<p><span >Note that the Crossref board has merely asked us to “explore” what it would take to remove dependencies. They have not asked us to actually take any action. Crossref has been massively supportive of the IDF and CNRI, and they have been massively supportive of us. Still, over the years we have all grown and our respective circumstances have changed. It is important that occasionally we question what we might have once considered to be axioms. As we discussed above, we use the term “persistent” which, in turn, is a synonym for “stubborn.” At the very least we need to document the inter-dependencies that we have so that we can understand just how stubborn we can reasonably expect our identifiers to be.</span></p>\n<p><span >The outage of January 20th was a humbling experience. But in a way we were lucky: Forgetting to renew the domain name was a silly and prosaic way to partially bring down a persistent identifier infrastructure, but it was also relatively easy to fix. Inevitably, there was a little snark and some pointed barbs directed at us during the outage, but we were truly overwhelmed by the support and constructive criticism we received as well. We have also been left with a clear message that, in order for this good-will to continue, we need to follow-up with a public, detailed and candid analysis of our infrastructure and its dependencies. Consider this to be the first section of a multi-part report.</span><figure id=\"attachment_539\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-539\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image01.png\" alt=\"@kevingashley tweets asking for followup analysis\" width=\"544\" height=\"63\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image01.png 544w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image01-300x35.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 85vw, 544px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></span> <span >@kevingashley tweets asking for followup analysis</span></figcaption></figure> <figure id=\"attachment_542\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-542\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image04.png\" alt=\"@WilliamKilbride tweets asking for followup and lessons learned\" width=\"539\" height=\"63\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image04.png 539w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/03/image04-300x35.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 539px) 85vw, 539px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></span> <span >@WilliamKilbride tweets asking for followup and lessons learned</span></figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-image-creditsspan\"><span >Image Credits</span></h3>\n<p><span >Turtle image CC-BY “Unrecognised MJ” from the Noun Project</span></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Real-time Stream of DOIs being cited in Wikipedia","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/real-time-stream-of-dois-being-cited-in-wikipedia/","published":"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000","description":"TL;DR Watch a real-time stream of DOIs being cited (and “un-cited!” ) in Wikipedia articles across the world: https://live.eventdata.crossref.org/live.html Background For years we’ve known that the Wikipedia...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Joe Wass","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<h2 id=\"span-tldrspan\"><span >TL;DR</span></h2>\n<p><span >Watch a real-time stream of DOIs being cited (and “un-cited!” ) in Wikipedia articles across the world: <a href=\"https://live.eventdata.crossref.org/live.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://live.eventdata.crossref.org/live.html</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-backgroundspan\"><span >Background</span></h2>\n<p><span >For years we’ve known that the Wikipedia was a major referrer of Crossref DOIs and about a year ago <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/many-metrics-such-data-wow/\">we confirmed</a> that, in fact, the Wikipedia is the 8th largest refer of Crossref DOIs. We know <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/domain.html?domain=wikipedia.org\">that people follow the DOIs</a>, too. This despite a fraction of Wikipedia citations to the scholarly literature even using DOIs. So back in August we decided to create a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/citation-needed/\">Wikimedia Ambassador programme</a>. The goal of the programme was to promote the use of persistent identifiers in citation and attribution in Wikipedia articles.</span> We would do this through outreach and through the development of better citation-related tools.</p>\n<p>Remember when we <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/many-metrics-such-data-wow\">originally wrote about our experiments with the PLOS ALM code</a> and how that has transitioned into the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-doi-event-tracker-pilot/\">DOI Event Tracking Pilot</a>? In those posts we mentioned that one of the hurdles in gathering information about DOI events is the actual process of polling third party APIs for activity related to millions of DOIs. Most parties simply wouldn’t be willing handle the load of a 100K API calls an hour. Besides, polling is a tremendously inefficient process, only a fraction of DOIs are ever going to generate events, but we’d have to poll for each of them, repeatedly, forever, to get an accurate picture of DOI activity. We needed a better way. We needed to see if we could reverse this process and convince some parties to instead “push” us information whenever they saw DOI related events (e.g. citations, downloads, shares, etc). If only we could convince somebody to try this…</p>\n<h2 id=\"wikipedia-doi-events\">Wikipedia DOI Events</h2>\n<p>In December 2014 we took the opportunity of the <a href=\"http://figshare.com/articles/ALM_Workshop_2014_Report/1287503\" target=\"_blank\">2014 PLOS/Crossref ALM Workshop</a> in San Francisco too meet with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Notconfusing\" target=\"_blank\">Max Klein</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dfko_0\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Di Franco</a> where we kicked off a very exciting project.</p>\n<p>There’s always someone editing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a> somewhere in the world. In fact, you can see a dizzying <a href=\"http://wikistream.wmflabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">live stream of edits</a>. We thought that given that there are so many DOIs in Wikipedia, that live stream may contain some diamonds (DOIs are made of diamond, that’s how they can be persistent). Max and Anthony went away and came back with a demo that contains a surprising amount of DOI activity.</p>\n<p>That demo is evolving into a concrete service, called <a href=\"https://github.com/notconfusing/cocytus\" target=\"_blank\">Cocytus</a>. It is running at Wikimedia Labs monitoring live edits as you read this.</p>\n<p>For now we’re feeding that data into the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150308012303/http://events.labs.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DOI Events Collection app</a> (which is an off-shoot of the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/introducing-chronograph/\">Chronograph project</a>). We are in the process of modifying the <a href=\"https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto\" target=\"_blank\">Lagotto code</a> so that we can instead push those events into the <a href=\"http://det.labs.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DOI Event Tracking Instance</a>.</p>\n<p>The first DOI event we noticed was delightfully prosaic: The DOI for <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1978942.1979213\" target=\"_blank\">“The polymath project”</a> is cited by the Wikipedia page for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project\" target=\"_blank\">“Polymath Project”</a>. Prosaic perhaps, but the authors of that paper probably want to know. Maybe they can help edit the page.</p>\n<p>Or how about this. Someone wrote a a paper about <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0144929x.2014.929744\" target=\"_blank\">why people edit Wikipedia</a> and then it was cited by Wikipedia. And then <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150321130048/http://events.labs.crossref.org/dois/10.1080/0144929x.2014.929744\" target=\"_blank\">the citation was removed</a>. The plot thickens…</p>\n<p>We’re interested in seeing how DOIs are used outside of the formal scholarly literature. What does that mean? We don’t fully know, that’s the point. We have retractions in scholarly literature (and our <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark\" target=\"_blank\">Crossmark metadata and service</a> allow publishers to record that), but it’s a bit different on Wikipedia. Edit wars are fought over … well you can <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars\" target=\"_blank\">see for yourself</a>.</p>\n<p>Citations can slip in and out of articles. We saw the DOI <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.832\" target=\"_blank\">10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.832</a> deleted from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder_in_children\" target=\"_blank\">“Bipolar disorder in children”</a>. If we’d not been monitoring the live feed (we had considered analysing snapshots of the Wikipedia in bulk) we might never have seen that. This is part of what non-traditional citations means, and it wasn’t obvious until we’d seen it.</p>\n<p>You can see this activity on the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150422055509/http://events.labs.crossref.org/events/types/WikipediaCitation\" target=\"_blank\">Chronograph’s stream</a>.

Please be aware that we’re only collecting newly added citations as of today. We do intend to go back and back-fill, but that may take some time- as it * cough * requires polling again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-technical-things\">Some Technical Things</h2>\n<p>A few interesting things that happened as a result of all this:</p>\n<h3 id=\"span-secure-urlsspan\"><span >Secure URLs</span></h3>\n<p><span >SSL and HTTPS were invented so you could do things like banking on the web without fear of interception or tampering. As the web becomes a more important part of life, many sites are upgrading from HTTP to HTTPS, the secure version. This is not only because your confidential details may be tampered with, but because certain governments might not like you reading certain materials.</span></p>\n<p><span >Because of this, some time ago, Wikipedia decided to embark on an upgrade to <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/08/01/future-https-wikimedia-projects/\">HTTPS</a> last year, and they are a certain way along the path. The <a href=\"http://www.doi.org/\">IDF</a>, who are responsible for running the DOI system, upgraded to HTTPS this Summer, although most DOIs are referred to by HTTP still.</span></p>\n<p><span >We met with <a href=\"http://nitens.org/taraborelli/home\">Dario Taraborelli</a> at the ALM workshop and discussed the DOI referral data that is fed into the <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org\">Chronograph</a>. We put two and two together and realised that Wikipedia was linking to DOIs (which are mostly HTTP) from pages which might be served over HTTPS. New policies in HTML5 specify that referrer URL headers shouldn’t be sent from HTTPS to HTTP (in case there was something secret in them). The upshot of this is, if someone’s browsing Wikipedia via HTTPS and click on a normal DOI, we won’t know that the user came from Wikipedia. Not a huge problem today, but as Wikipedia switches over to entirely secure, we’re going to miss out on very useful information.</span></p>\n<p><span >Fortunately, the HTML5 specification includes a way to fix this (without leaking sensitive information). We discussed this with Dario, and he did some research, and <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikimedia_referrer_policy\">came up with a suggestion</a>, which got <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research_talk:Wikimedia_referrer_policy\">discussed</a>. It’s fascinating to watch a democratic process like this take place and take part in it.</span></p>\n<p><span >We’re waiting to see how the discussion turns out, and hope that it all works out so we can continue to report on how amazing Wikipedia is at sending people to scholarly literature.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-how-shall-i-cite-theespan\"><span >How shall I cite thee?</span></h3>\n<p><span >Another discussion grew out of that process, and we started talking to a Wikipedian called Nemo (note to Latin scholars: we weren’t just talking to ourselves). Nemo (real name Federico Leva) had a few suggestions of his own. Another way to solve the referrer problem is by using HTTPS URLs (HTML5 allows browsers to send the referrer domain when going from HTTPS to HTTPS).</span></p>\n<p><span >This means going back to all the articles that use DOIs and change them from HTTP to HTTPS. Not as simple as it sounds, and it doesn’t sound simple. We started looking into how DOIs were cited on Wikipedia.</span></p>\n<p><span >After some research we found that there are more ways that we expected to cite DOIs.</span></p>\n<p><span >First, there’s the URL.

Upgrading infrastructure isn’t trivial, and, with over 4000 members (mostly publishers), most Crossref DOIs will still redirect to standard HTTP pages for the foreseeable future.</span></p>\n<p><span >You can keep as secure as possible by using <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS Everywhere</a>.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-finspan\"><span >Fin</span></h2>\n<p><span >There’s lots going on, watch this space to see developments.

A lot, it turns out. About a week after our post, we were contacted by a group of our members from <a href=\"http://oaspa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OASPA</a> who expressed an interest in working with the system. Apparently they were all about to conduct similar experiments using the ALM code, and they thought that it might be more efficient and interesting if they did so together using our installation. Yippee. Publishers working together. That’s what we’re all about.</p>\n<p>So we convened the interested parties and had a meeting to discuss what problems they were trying to solve and how Crossref might be able to help them. That early meeting came to a consensus on a number of issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The group was interested in exploring the role Crossref could play in providing an open, common infrastructure to track activities around DOIs, they were not interested in having Crossref play a role in the value-add services of reporting on an interpreting the meaning of said activities.</li>\n<li>The working group needed representatives from multiple stakeholders in the industry. Not just open access publishers from OASPA, but from subscription based publishers, funders, researchers and third party service providers as well.</li>\n<li>That it was desirable to conduct a pilot to see if the proposed approach was both technically feasible and financially sustainable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so after that meeting, the “experiment” graduated to becoming a “pilot.” This Crossref pilot is based on the premise that the infrastructure involved in tracking common information about “DOI events” can be usefully separated from the value-added services of analysing and presenting these events in the form of qualitative indicators. There are many forms of events and interactions which may be of interest. Service providers will wish to analyse, aggregate and present those in a range of different ways depending on the customer and their problem. The capture of the underlying events can be kept separate from those services.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure that the Crossref pilot is not mistaken for some sub rosa attempt to establish new metrics for evaluating scholarly output, we also decided eschew any moniker that includes the word “metrics” or synonyms. So the “ALM Experiment” is dead. Long live the “”DOI Event Tracker” (DET) pilot. Similarly PLOS’s <a href=\"https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto\" target=\"_blank\">open source “ALM software”</a> has been resurrected under the name “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagotto_Romagnolo\" target=\"_blank\">Lagotto</a>.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-technical-issues\">The Technical Issues</h2>\n<p>Crossref members are interested in knowing about “events” relating to the DOIs that identify their content. But our members face a now-classic problem. There are a large number of sources for scholarly publications (3k+ Crossref members) and that list is still growing. Similarly, there are an unbounded number of potential sources for usage information. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supplemental and grey literature (e.g. data, software, working papers)</li>\n<li>Orthogonal professional literature (e.g. patents, legal documents, governmental/NGO/IGO reports, consultation reports, professional trade literature).</li>\n<li>Scholarly tools (e.g. citation management systems, text and data mining applications).</li>\n<li>Secondary outlets for scholarly literature (institutional and disciplinary repositories, A&amp;I services).</li>\n<li>Mainstream media (e.g. BBC, New York Times).</li>\n<li>Social media (e.g. Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, Blogs, Yo).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, there is a broad and growing audience of stakeholders who are interested in seeing how the literature is being used. The audience includes publishers themselves as well as funders, researchers, institutions, policy makers and citizens.</p>\n<p>Publishers (or other stakeholders) could conceivably each choose to run their own system to collect this information and redistribute it to interested parties. Or they can work with a vendor to do the same. But either case, they would face the following problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The N sources will change. New ones will emerge. Old ones will vanish.</li>\n<li>The N audiences will change. New ones will emerge. Old ones will vanish.</li>\n<li>Each publisher/vendor will need to deal with N source’s different APIs, rate limits, T&amp;Cs, data licenses, etc. This is a logistical headache for both the publishers/vendors and for the sources.</li>\n<li>Each audience will need to deal with N publisher/vendor APIs, rate limits, T&amp;Cs, data licenses, etc. This is a logistical headache for both the audiences and for the publishers.</li>\n<li>If publishers/vendors use different systems which in turn look at different sources, it will be difficult to compare or audit results across publishers/vendors.</li>\n<li>If a journal moves from one publisher to another, then how are the metrics for that journal’s articles going to follow the journal?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then there is the simple issue of scale. Most parties will be interested in comparing the data that they collect for their own content, with data about their competitors. Hence, if they all run their own system, they will each be querying much more than their own data. If, for example, just the commercial third-party providers were interested in collecting data covering the formal scholarly literature, they would <em>each</em> find themselves querying the same sources for the same 80 million DOIs. To put this into perspective, to refresh the data for 10 million DOIs once a month, would require sources to support ~ 14K API calls an hour. 60 million DOIs would require 100K API calls an hour. Current standard API caps for many of the sources that people are interested in querying hover around 2K per hour. We may see these sources lift that cap for exceptional cases, but they are unlikely to do so for many different clients all of whom are querying essentially the same thing.</p>\n<p>These issues typify the “multiple bilateral relationships” problem that Crossref was founded to try and ameliorate. When we have many organizations trying to access the exact same APIs to process the exact same data (albeit to different ends), then it seems likely that Crossref could help make the process more efficient.</p>\n<h2 id=\"piloting-a-proposed-solution\">Piloting A Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p>The Crossref DET pilot aims to show the feasibility of providing a hub for the collection, storage and propagation of DOI events from multiple sources to multiple audiences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-collection\">Data Collection</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pull</strong>: DET will collect DOI event data from sources that are of common interest to the membership, but which are unlikely to make special efforts to accommodate the scholarly communications industry. Examples of this class of source include large, broadly popular services like FaceBook, Twitter, VK, Sina Weibo, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Push</strong>: DET will allow sources to send DOI event data directly to Crossref in one of three ways:\n<ul>\n<li>Standard Linkback: Using standards that are widely used on the web. This will automatically enable linkback-aware systems like WordPress, Moveable Type, etc. to alert DET to DOI events.</li>\n<li>Scholarly Linkback: A to-be-defined augmented linkback-style API which will be optimized to work with scholarly resources and which will allow for more sophisticated payloads including other identifiers (e.g. ORCIDs, FundRefs), metadata, provenance information and authorization information. This system could be used by tools designed for scholarly communications. So, for example, it could be used by publisher platforms to distribute events related to downloads or comments within their discussion forums. It could also be used by third party scholarly apps like Zotero, Mendeley, Papers, Authorea, IRUS-UK, etc. in order to alert interested parties in events related to specific DOIs.</li>\n<li><strong>Redirect</strong>: DET will also be able to serve as a service discovery layer that will allow sources to push DOI event data directly to an appropriate publisher-controlled endpoint using the above scholarly linkback mechanism. This can be used by sources like repositories in order to send sensitive usage data directly to the relevant publishers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"data-propagation\">Data Propagation</h3>\n<p>Parties may want to use the DET in order to propagate information about DOI events. The system will support two broad data propagation patterns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>one-to-many</strong>: DOI events that are commonly harvested (pulled) by the DET system from a single source will be distributed freely to anybody who queries the DET API. Similarly, sources that push DOI events via the standard or scholarly linkback mechanisms, will also propagate their DOI events openly to anybody who queries the DET API. DOI events that are propagated in either of these cases will be kept and logged by the DET system along with appropriate provenance information. This will be the most common, default propagation model for the DET system.</li>\n<li><strong>one-to-one</strong>: Sources of DOI events can also report (push) DOI event data directly to owner of the relevant DOI <em>if</em> the DOI owner provides &amp; registers a suitable end-point with the DET system. In these cases, data sources seeking to report information relating to a DOI, will be redirected (with a suitable 30X HTTP status and relevant headers) to the end-point specified by the DOI owner. The DET system will not keep the request or provenance information. One-to-one propagation model is designed to handle use cases where the source of the DOI event has put restrictions on the data and will only share the DOI events with the owner (registrant) of the DOI. This use case may be used, for example, by aggregators or A&amp;I services that want to report confidential data directly back to a publisher. The advantage of the redirect mechanism is that Crossref is not put into the position of having to secure sensitive data as said data will never reside on Crossref systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the two patterns can be combined. So, for example, a publisher might want to have public social media events reported to the DET and propagated accordingly, but to also to private third parties report confidential information directly to the publisher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-where-are-we\">So Where Are We?</h2>\n<p>So to start with, the DET Working Group has grown substantially since the early days and we have representatives from a wide variety of stakeholders. The group includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cameron Neylon, PLOS</li>\n<li>Chris Shillum, Elsevier</li>\n<li>Dom Mitchell, Co-action Publishing</li>\n<li>Euan Adie, Altmetric</li>\n<li>Jennifer Lin, PLOS</li>\n<li>Juan Pablo Alperin, PKP</li>\n<li>Kevin Dolby, Wellcome Trust</li>\n<li>Liz Ferguson, Wiley</li>\n<li>Maciej Rymarz, Mendeley</li>\n<li>Mark Patterson, eLife</li>\n<li>Martin Fenner, PLOS</li>\n<li>Mike Thelwell, U Wolverhampton</li>\n<li>Rachel Craven, BMC</li>\n<li>Richard O’Beirne, OUP</li>\n<li>Ruth Ivimey-Cook, eLife</li>\n<li>Victoria Rao, Elsevier</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As well as the usual contingent of Crossref cat-herders including: Geoffrey Bilder, Rachael Lammey &amp; Joe Wass.</p>\n<p>When we announced the then-DET experiment, we said that one of the biggest challenges would be to create something that scaled to industry levels. At launch, we only loaded in about 317,500+ Crossref DOIs representing publications from 2014 and we could see the system was going to struggle. Since then Martin Fenner and Jennifer Lin at PLOS have been focusing on making sure that the Lagotto code scales appropriately and now it is currently humming along with just over 11.5 million DOIs for which we’ve gathered over 64 million “events.” We aren’t worried about scalability on that front any more.</p>\n<p>We’ve also shown that third parties should be able to access the API to provide value added reporting and metrics. As a demonstration of this, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150924184918/http://parascope.crowdometer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PLOS configured a copy of its reporting software “Parascope”</a> to point at the Crossref DET instance. The next step we’re taking is to start testing the “push” API mechanism and the “point-to-point redirect” API mechanism. For the push API, we should have a really exciting demo available to show within the next few days. And on the point-to-point redirect, we have a sub-group exploring how the point-to-point redirect mechanism could potentially be used for reporting <a href=\"http://www.projectcounter.org/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">COUNTER</a> stats as a compliment to the <a href=\"http://www.niso.org/workrooms/sushi\" target=\"_blank\">Sushi</a> initiative.</p>\n<p>The other major outstanding task we have before us is to calculate what the costs will be of running the DET system as a production service. In this case we expect to have some pretty accurate data to go on as we will have had close to half a year of running the pilot with a non-trivial number of DOIs and sources. Note that the work group is concerned to ensure that the underlying data from the system remains open to all. Keeping this raw data open as seen as critical to establishing trust in the metrics and reporting systems that third parties build on the data. The group has also committed to leaving the creation of value-add services to third parties. As such we have been focusing on exploring business models based around service-level-agreement backed versions of the API to complement the free version of the same API. The free API will come with no guarantees of uptime, performance characteristics or support. For those users that depend on the API in order to deliver their services, we will offer paid-for SLA-backed versions of the free APIs. We can then configure our systems so that we can independently scale these SLA-backed APIs in order to meet SLA agreements.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to have these calculations complete in time for the working group to make a recommendation to the Crossref board meeting in July 2015.</p>\n<p>Until then, we’ll use CrossTech as a venue for notifying people when we’ve hit new milestones or added new capabilities to the DET Pilot system.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Problems with dx.doi.org on January 20th 2015- what we know.","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/problems-with-dx.doi.org-on-january-20th-2015-what-we-know./","published":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Hell’s teeth.

Our information from CNRI was that the problem had to do with a mistaken change to a DNS record and that the domain name wasn’t the issue. We corrected people who were reporting that domain name renewal as the cause, but eventually we learned that it was actually true. We have had it confirmed that the problem originated with CNRI manually renewing the domain name at the last minute. Ugh. <span >CNRI will issue a statement soon. We’ll link to it as soon as they do.</span> UPDATE (Jan 21st): CNRI has sent Crossref a statement.

Some have even said that the event underscores a point we often make about so-called “persistent-identifiers”- which is that they are not magic technology; the “persistence” is the result of a social contract. We like to say that Crossref DOIs are as persistent as Crossref staff. Well, to that phrase we have to add “and IDF staff” and “CNRI staff” and “ICANN staff”.

We need to learn something practical from this. How can we guard against this type of problem in the future? Again, people following this issue on Twitter have already been helping with suggestions and ideas. Can we crowd-source the monitoring of persistent identifier SLAs? Could we leverage Wikipedia, Wikidata or something similar to monitor critical identifiers and other infrastructure like purls, DOIs, handles, PMIDs, perma.cc, etc? Should we be looking at designating special exceptions to the normal rules governing DNS names? Do we need to distribute the risk more? Or is it enough <em>cough</em> to simply ensure that somebody, somewhere in the dependency chain had enabled DNS protection and auto-renewal for critical infrastructure DNS names?</span></p>\n<p><span >Truly, we are humbled.

Obviously, DOIs are used heavily within the formal scholarly literature and for citations, but they’re increasingly being used outside of formal publications in places we didn’t expect. With our DOI Event Tracking / ALM pilot project we’re collecting information about how DOIs are mentioned on the open web to try and build a picture about new methods of citation.</p>\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/many-metrics-such-data-wow\">preparation for collaborating with Wikipedia</a>, we looked at our statistics about when DOIs are clicked and discovered that Wikipedia was, over a two year period from 2012, the eighth largest referrer of DOIs. This means that not only does Wikipedia have a lot of DOIs, but people click them too. This bit of one-off data analysis (which surprised us) gave us enough of a prod to kickstart our collaboration with Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\">ALM Workshop 2014 in San Francisco</a> we talked to some Wikipedians and bibliometricians and realised that we were sitting on a really interesting data-set and that it would be churlish not to share it. At the hackathon (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1287503\" target=\"_blank\">read the report here</a>) we started work on a service to gather information about DOIs and, a month later, we’re ready to unveil the DOI Chronograph.</p>\n<p><strong>Show me the goods</strong></p>\n<p>You can see:</p>\n<p>Daily referrals (clicks) from top level domains, e.g. Wikipedia.org: <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/domain.html?domain=wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/domain.html?domain=wikipedia.org</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/01/wikipedia-referrals.png\" alt=\"wikipedia-referrals\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>Daily referrals from specific subdomains, e.g. fr.wikipedia.org: <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/domain.html?domain=fr.wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/domain.html?domain=fr.wikipedia.org</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/01/fr-wikipedia-referrals.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p>Daily resolutions per DOI: <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/doi.html?doi=10.1787%2F20752288\" target=\"_blank\">http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/doi.html?doi=10.1787%2F20752288</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/01/doi-referrals.png\" alt=\"doi-referrals\" class=\"img-responsive\"/>\n<p><a name=\"ranking\"></a></p>\n<p>And, the chart that kicked this all off: DOI referring domains league tables. This shows that Wikipedia is the 3rd or 4th non-traditional referrer of DOIs (i.e. excluding referrals from Publishers’ domains): <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/top.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/top.html</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2015/01/top-domains.png\" alt=\"top-domains\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\n<p><strong>Try it out</strong></p>\n<p>Visit the Chronograph and give it a try <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">chronograph.labs.crossref.org</a> on your <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/doi.html?doi=10.1657%2F1938-4246-44.4.483\" target=\"_blank\">favourite DOI</a> (<a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/doi.html?doi=10.1007%2Fs12110-002-1021-6\" target=\"_blank\">everyone</a> <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/doi.html?doi=10.1136%2Fbmj.327.7429.1459\" target=\"_blank\">has</a> <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/doi.html?doi=10.1016/j.imavis.2011.05.002\" target=\"_blank\">one</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>More data</strong></p>\n<p>Talking to a bibliometrician we also realised we can correlate other data for DOIs. We’re getting the issue date (approximately the publication date) from our own metadata, as well as the date that the Crossref metadata was updated. This gives interesting results, like <a href=\"http://chronograph.labs.crossref.org/doi.html?doi=10.1038%2Fncomms2953\" target=\"_blank\">the resolutions for 10.1038/ncomms2953</a>, which peak after publication and then tails off.

Specifically, we currently have the logs for 2012 to 2014 (we’re working at digging out the rest), and the referral information for 50 million DOIs (out of 71 million). That number will be higher by the time you read this. If your page is slow to load, be patient, as it’s currently working hard crunching numbers.</p>\n<p>This project is focused on exploring the use of DOIs outside of the formal literature. As such, we are only looking at referrals from domains that do not appear to belong to primary publishers (i.e. our members). If you try a domain and it doesn’t work, it could be that the domain belongs to one of our members. If you’ve notice any mistakes, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:labs@crossref.org\">labs@crossref.org</a> .</p>\n<p>Finally, these numbers contain all DOI resolutions. That’s human clicks but also content negotiation to retrieve metadata, robots etc. We might try to filter them in future, but for now be aware that not every visitor is a human.</p>\n<p>I’ll detail some of the the technical stuff (it’s very interesting) and what happened next with Wikipedia in a future post.

Indeed, this week I am in Amsterdam to attend the 4th RDA plenary in which this topic will no doubt again garner a lot of deserved attention.</span></p>\n<p><span >We hope that the small example above will help push the RDAs agenda a little further. Like the recent <a href=\"http://odin-project.eu\">ODIN</a> project, It illustrates how we can simply combine two existing scholarly infrastructure systems to build important new functionality for integrating research objects into the scholarly literature.</span></p>\n<p><span >Does it solve all of the problems associated with citing and referring to data? Can the various workgroups at RDA just cancel their data citation sessions and spend the week riding bikes and gorging on croquettes? Of course not. But my guess is that by simply integrating DataCite and Crossref in this way, we can make a giant push in the right direction.</span></p>\n<p><span >There are certainly going to be differences between traditional citation and data citation. Some even claim that citing data isn’t “as simple as citing traditional literature.” But this is a caricature of traditional citation. If you believe this, go off an peruse the MLA, Chicago, Harvard, NLM and APA citation guides. Then read <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674307605\"> Anthony Grafton’s, <em>The Footnote</em></a>? Are you back yet? Good, so let’s continue…</span></p>\n<p><span >Citation <em>of any sort</em> is a complex issue- full of subtleties, edge-cases exceptions, disciplinary variations and kludges. Historically, the way to deal with these edge-cases has been social, not technical. For traditional literature we have simply evolved and documented citation practices which generally make contextually-appropriate use of the same technical infrastructure (footnotes, endnotes, metadata, etc.). I suspect the same will be true in citing data. The solutions will not be technical, they will mostly be social. Researchers, and publishers will evolve new, contextually appropriate mechanisms to use existing infrastructure deal with the peculiarities of data citation.</span></p>\n<p><span >Does this mean that we will never have to develop new systems to handle data citation? Possibly But I don’t think we’ll know what those systems are or how they should work until we’ve actually had researchers attempting to use and adapt the tools we have.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"span-technical-backgroundspan\"><span >Technical background</span></h3>\n<p><span >About five years ago, Crossref and DataCite explored the possibility of exposing linkages between DataCite and Crossref DOIs. Accordingly, we spent some time trying to assemble an example corpus that would illustrate the power of interlinking these identifiers. We encountered a slight problem.

This <em>despite</em> only a fraction of eligible references in the free encyclopaedia using DOIs.</p>\n<p>We aim to fix that. Crossref and Wikimedia are launching a new initiative to better integrate scholarly literature in the world’s largest public knowledge space, Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>This work will help promote standard links to scholarly references within Wikipedia, which persist over time by ensuring consistent use of DOIs and other citation identifiers in Wikipedia references. Crossref will support the development and maintenance of Wikipedia’s citation tools on Wikipedia. This work will include bug fixes and performance improvements for existing tools, extending the tools to enable Wikipedia contributors to more easily look up and insert DOIs, and providing a “linkback” mechanism that alerts relevant parties when a persistent identifier is used in a Wikipedia reference.</p>\n<p>In addition, Crossref is creating the role of Wikimedia Ambassador (modeled after <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian_in_Residence\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedian-in-Residence</a>) to act as liaison with the Wikimedia community, promote use of scholarly references on Wikipedia, and educate about DOIs and other scholarly identifiers (ORCIDs, PubMed IDs, DataCite DOIs, etc) across Wikimedia projects.</p>\n<p>Starting today, Crossref will be working with <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/many-metrics-such-data-wow\">Daniel Mietchen</a> to coordinate Crossref’s Wikimedia-related activities. Daniel’s team will be composed of <a href=\"https://github.com/notconfusing\" target=\"_blank\">Max Klein</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/wrought\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Senate</a>, who will work to enhance Wikimedia citation tools, and will share the role of Wikipedia ambassador with <a href=\"http://www.dorothyhoward.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dorothy Howard</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beginnings of Wikipedia, Daniel Mietchen has worked to integrate scholarly content into Wikimedia projects. He is part of an impressive community of active Wikipedians and developers who have worked extensively on linking Wikipedia articles to the formal literature and other scholarly resources. We’ve been talking to him about this project for nearly a year, and are happy to finally get it off the ground.</p>\n<p>-G<figure id=\"attachment_367\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0602-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"Matt, Max and Daniel at #wikimania2014.

It can be summarized like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crossref keeps and manages a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\" target=\"_blank\">canonical list</a> of Funder Names (ephemeral) and associated identifiers (persistent).</li>\n<li>We encourage our members (or anybody, really- the list is available under A <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/\" target=\"_blank\">CC-Zero</a> license waiver) to use this list for collecting information on who funded the research behind the content that our members publish.</li>\n<li>We then ask that our members deposit this data in their normal Crossref metadata deposits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that was cool.</p>\n<p>But then people started asking us awkward questions. Questions like “what can I do with the funder data?” and “how do I query it?”.</p>\n<p>Stoopit people.</p>\n<p>Can’t you just let us bask for a few minutes in the sunny glow of actually conceiving of and launching a project within a year?</p>\n<p>But seriously, funders, were interested to see how they could use the funder metadata being collected in Crossref. In particular, some funding agencies were interested in being able to measure Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs” to management wonks) related to recent mandates such as the February 22nd 2013 OSTP memo, <em><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research\" target=\"_blank\">Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research</a>.</em> Two groups also approached us, <a href=\"http://chorusaccess.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CHORUS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/public-access-policies/shared-access-research-ecosystem-share#.U0Z0lOZdWsw\" target=\"_blank\">SHARE</a>. Both are interested in exploring how to build reporting tools for funders, institutions and researchers and each brought us a gigantic hairball of use-cases they were hoping we would be able to meet.</p>\n<p>Conveniently, we were in the process of creating a revised, modern Crossref API that is entirely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword_compliant\" target=\"_blank\">buzzword-compliant</a>, and so we set to work…</p>\n<p>We thought people might be interested in seeing what you can do with the Crossref <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\" target=\"_blank\">REST</a> API in relation to funding information and the expectations that are increasingly being attached to them. CHORUS is already using the Crossref REST API heavily and we expect that SHARE will soon start making use of it as well. The feedback from both groups has been very useful, but we are looking for broader feedback as well. The API is still in development, so now is your chance to help us shape it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brief-examples\">Brief Examples</h2>\n<p><em>Please note</em>, the following are APIs calls, although you can copy and paste the URIs into your browser, the data is returned in a machine readable representation called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\" target=\"_blank\">JSON</a>. If you want the results to look a little more presentable, we advise you install the JSONView plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox Users: <a href=\"http://jsonview.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JSONView</a></li>\n<li>Chrome Users: <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc\" target=\"_blank\">JSONView</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also note that publishers have only just started to deposit the metadata needed for these APIs to work, so the data is currently sparse. We know that many of our members are working feverishly to populate more of the needed metadata, but this requires updates to the their manuscript tracking systems, production systems and hosting systems. It takes time.</p>\n<p>But for now you can paste the relevant URIs below into your browser and see the results that we do have. Expect these numbers to increase sharply over the next few months</p>\n<p>To start with, you might want to know how many articles in Crossref have FundRef metadata:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?filter=has-funder:true&amp;rows=0\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could then be interested in knowing how many works in Crossref use FundRef to credit the United States’ National Science Foundation (NSF) for funding their research? First you need to find out what the FundRef identifier is for the NSF:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/funders?query=NSF\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that there are several entries that match “NSF”, and that the one we are looking for has the identifier <code>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</code>. Remember, funding agency names can change frequently, the ID provides a persistent link to the funder even if their name changes.</p>\n<p>If you are curious, you can see the details for the NSF entry, including its location, parent and child organizations:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/funders/10.13039/100000001\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the results also lists the <code>work-count</code>. This is the number of works in the Crossref metadata that list the US NSF as having funded the research.</p>\n<p>So perhaps you would like to see the list of works. The following will list the first twenty:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/funders/10.13039/100000001/works\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can page through the results with the offset argument:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/funders/10.13039/100000001/works?offset=20\nhttps://api.crossref.org/v1/funders/10.13039/100000001/works?offset=40\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>How many works that have listed the NSF as a funder have license information:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/funders/10.13039/100000001/works?filter=has-license:true&amp;rows=0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lets see the first batch that have license information:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/funders/10.13039/100000001/works?filter=has-license:true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lets look at the metadata for one of the DOIs returned:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.1063/1.3593378\n</code></pre>\n<p>Interesting, the metadata shows an article published by <a href=\"http://www.aip.org/\" target=\"_blank\">AIP</a>. It includes license information (CC-BY 3.0) as well as a link to the full text. If you follow the link to the full text, you can retrieve it:</p>\n<pre><code>http://link.aip.org/link/applab/v98/i21/p216101/pdf/CHORUS\n</code></pre>\n<p>Wow- A pretty short article. But you can see that it does credit the NSF and that the award number recorded in the text is the same as the award number recorded in the FundRef section of the Crossref metadata. Yay.</p>\n<p>You can see in the brief examples above that there is a lot of other metadata you may want to query on and explore. It can include ORCIDS, information about archiving arrangements- even abstracts. It all depends on what the Crossref member has decided to provide.</p>\n<p>You can get a simple overview of what a Crossref member has provided by looking at a member summary. Here is an example for <a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hindawi</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/members?query=hindawi\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note again that names are fickle, so the above query can also be accomplished using the member identifier like this:</p>\n<pre><code>https://api.crossref.org/v1/members/98\n</code></pre>\n<p>Groovy init?</p>\n<p>If you want more pointers on where you can learn how to use the API, read on…</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-examples-and-documentation\">More examples and documentation.</h2>\n<p>We have a draft of the <a href=\"https://api.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">full documentation for the Crossref REST API</a>. Note that this is undergoing active revision and we ask that you look at the updated documentation if things that once work cease to. We would also love your feedback and suggestions. Send them to:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2013/01/labs_email.png\" alt=\"email address\"></p>\n<p>We often get asked “what metadata does a publisher need to provide in order to enable this kind of functionality?” To answer that, we have developed a document titled <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/funder_kpi_metadata_best_practice.md\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref metadata best practice to support key performance indicators (KPIs) for funding agencies</a>. Try saying that ten times very fast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-the-crossref-rest-api\">The Future of the Crossref REST API.</h2>\n<p>Our aim is for the Crossref REST API to go into production this Summer (2014). As with most of our newer APIs, there will be a free API for public use and a paid for API for professional use. The only difference between the two will be that the professional version will come with a service level agreement (SLA) covering uptime, response time and support. Naturally, this also means that the professional one will be on dedicated hosting equipment so that we can meet these SLAs, whereas the performance of the free version will be subject to the vicissitudes inherent in using a shared, constrained resource (i.e. the server and network it is running on).</p>\n<p>Again, the basics of the API are in place. It should be fairly stable, but we do reserve the right to make changes to it over the next few months. Please send us feedback.</p>\n<p>— The Weasel</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Many Metrics.

At <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/labs\">Crossref Labs</a>, we thought it might be interesting to see what would happen if we ran our own instance of the system and loaded it up with a few Crossref DOIs. So we did. And the code fell over. Oops. Somehow it didn’t like dealing with 10 million DOIs. Funny that.</p>\n<p>But the beauty of OSS is that we were able to work with PLOS to scale the code to handle our volume of data. Crossref contracted with <a href=\"http://cottagelabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cottage Labs</a>  and we both worked with PLOS to make changes to the system. These eventually got fed back into the main <a href=\"https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm/\" target=\"_blank\">ALM source on Github</a>. Now everybody benefits from our work. Yay for OSS.</p>\n<p>So if you want to know technical details, skip to <a href=\"#details\">Details for Propellerheads</a>. But if you want to know why we did this, and what we plan to do with it, read on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"span-whyspan\"><span >Why?</span></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >There are (cough) some problems in our industry that we can best solve with shared infrastructure. When publishers first put scholarly content online, they used to make bilateral reference linking agreements. These agreements allowed them to link citations using each other’s proprietary reference linking APIs. But this system didn’t scale. It was too time-consuming to negotiate all the agreements needed to link to other publishers. And linking through many proprietary citation APIs was too complex and too fragile. So the industry founded Crossref to create a common, cross-publisher citation linking API. Crossref has since obviated the need for bilateral linking arrangements.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >So-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics\" target=\"_blank\">altmetrics</a> look like they might have similar characteristics. You have ~4000 Crossref member publishers and N sources (e.g. Twitter, Mendeley, Facebook, CiteULike, etc.) where people use (e.g. discuss, bookmark, annotate, etc.) scholarly publications. Publishers could conceivably each choose to run their own system to collect this information. But if they did, they would face the following problems:</span>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >The N sources will be volatile. New ones will emerge. Old ones will vanish.</span></li>\n<li><span >Each publisher will need to deal with each source’s different APIs, rate limits, T&amp;Cs, data licenses, etc. This is a logistical headache for both the publishers and for the sources.</span></li>\n<li><span >If publishers use different systems which in turn look at different sources, it will be difficult to compare results across publishers.</span></li>\n<li><span >If a journal moves from one publisher to another, then how are the metrics for that journal’s articles going to follow the journal? This isn’t a complete list, but it shows that there might be some virtue in publishers sharing an infrastructure for collecting this data. But what about commercial providers? Couldn’t they provide these ALM services? Of course - and some of them currently do. But normally they look on the actual collection of this data as a means to an end. The real value they provide is in the analysis, reporting and tools that they build on top of the data. Crossref has no interest in building front-ends to this data. If there is a role for us to play here, it is simply in the collection and distribution of the data.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"span-no-really-whyspan\"><span >No, really, WHY?</span></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >Aren’t these altmetrics <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170112105521/https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/08/01/article-level-metrics/\" target=\"_blank\">an ill-conceived and meretricious idea</a>? By providing this kind of information, isn’t Crossref just encouraging feckless, <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/01/27/its-the-neoliberalism-stupid-kansa/\" target=\"_blank\">neoliberal university administrators</a> to hasten academia’s slide into a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement\" target=\"_blank\">Stakhanovite</a> dystopia?

They know better.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >But yes, it is still likely that some powerful people will come to lazy conclusions based on altmetrics. And following that, other lazy, unscrupulous and opportunistic people will attempt to game said metrics. We may even see an industry emerge to exploit this mess and provide the scholarly equivalent of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\" target=\"_blank\">SEO</a>. Feh. Now I’m depressed and I need a drink.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >So again, why is Crossref doing this? Though we have our doubts about how effective altmetrics will be in evaluating the quality of content, we do believe that they are a useful tool for understanding how scholarly content is used and interpreted. <em>The most eloquent arguments against altmetrics for measuring quality, inadvertently make the case for altmetrics as a tool for monitoring attention.</em></span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >Critics of altmetrics point out that much of the attention that research receives outside of formal scholarly communications channels can be ascribed to:</span>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >Puffery. Researchers and/or university/publisher “<a href=\"http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6369\" target=\"_blank\">PR wonks</a>” over-promoting research results.</span></li>\n<li><span >Innocent misinterpretation. A lay audience simply doesn’t understand the research results.</span></li>\n<li><span >Deliberate misinterpretation.

The research appears to be about sex, drugs, crime, video games or other popular bogeymen.</span></li>\n<li><span >Neurobollocks. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160405135736/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/08/neurobollocks\" target=\"_blank\">A category unto itself these days</a>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >In short, scholarly research might be misinterpreted. Shock horror. Ban all metrics. Whew. That won’t happen again.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >Scholarly research has always been discussed outside of formal scholarly venues. Both by scholars themselves and by interested laity. Sometimes these discussions advance the scientific cause. Sometimes they undermine it. The University of Utah didn’t depend on widespread Internet access or social networks to promote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion\" target=\"_blank\">yet-to-be peer-reviewed claims about cold fusion</a>. That was just old-fashioned analogue puffery. And the Internet played no role in the Laetrile or<a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/dmso\" target=\"_blank\"> DMSO crazes of the 1980s</a>. You see, there were once these things called “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper\" target=\"_blank\">newspapers.</a>” And another thing called “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television\" target=\"_blank\">television.</a>” And a sophisticated <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace\" target=\"_blank\">meatspace</a>-based social network called a “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square\" target=\"_blank\">town square</a>.”</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >But there are critical differences between then and now. As <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research\" target=\"_blank\">citizens get more access to the scholarly literature</a>, it is far more likely that research is going to be discussed outside of formal scholarly venues. Now we can build tools to help researchers track these discussions. Now researchers can, if they need to, engage in the conversations as well. One would think that conscientious researchers would see it as their responsibility to remain engaged, to know how their research is being used. And especially to know when it is being misused.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >That isn’t to say that we expect researchers will welcome this task. We are no Pollyannas. Researchers are already famously overstretched. They <a href=\"https://ddoi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2009.02.002\" target=\"_blank\">barely have time to keep up with the formally published literature</a>. It seems cruel to expect them to keep up with the firehose of the Internet as well.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >Which gets us back to the value of altmetrics tools. Our hope is that, as altmetrics tools evolve, they will provide publishers and researchers with an efficient mechanism for monitoring the use of their content in non-traditional venues. Just in the way that citations were used before they were distorted into proxies for credit and kudos.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >We don’t think altmetrics are there yet. Partly because some parties are still tantalized by the prospect of usurping one metric for another. But mostly because the entire field is still nascent. People don’t yet know how the information can be combined and used effectively. So we still make naive assumptions such as “link=like” and “more=better.” Surely it will eventually occur to somebody that, instead, there may be a connection between <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/magazine/diederik-stapels-audacious-academic-fraud.html?_r=1&\" target=\"_blank\">repeated headline-grabbing research and academic fraud</a>. A neuroscientist might be interested in a tool that alerts them if the MRI scans in their research paper are being misinterpreted on the web to promote neurobollocks. An immunologist may want to know if their research is being misused by the anti-vaccination movement. Perhaps the real value in gathering this data will be seen when somebody builds tools to help researchers DETECT puffery, social-citation cabals, and misinterpretation of research results?</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >But Crossref won’t be building those tools. What we might be able to do is help others overcome another hurdle that blocks the development of more sophisticated tools; getting hold of the needed data in the first place. This is why we are dabbling in altmetrics.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >Wikipedia is already the 8th largest referrer of Crossref DOIs. Note that this doesn’t just mean that the Wikipedia cites lots of Crossref DOIs, it means that people actually click on and follow those DOIs to the scholarly literature. As scholarly communication transcends traditional outlets and as the audience for scholarly research broadens, we think that it will be more important for publishers and researcher to be aware of how their research is being discussed and used. They may even need to engage more with non-scholarly audiences. In order to do this, they need to be aware of the conversations. Crossref is providing this experimental data source in the hope that we can spur the development of more sophisticated tools for detecting and analyzing these conversations. Thankfully, this is an inexpensive experiment to conduct - largely thanks to the decision on the part of PLOS to open source its ALM code.</span>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-now\">What Now?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\nCrossref’s instance of PLOS’s ALM code is an experiment. We mentioned that we had encountered scalability problems and that we had resolved some of them. But there are still big scalability issues to address. For example, assuming a response time of 1 second, if we wanted to poll the English-language version of the Wikipedia to see what had cited each of the 65 million DOIs held in Crossref, the process would take years to complete. But this is how the system is designed to work at the moment.<span > It polls various source APIs to see if a particular DOI is “mentioned”. Parallelizing the queries might reduce the amount of time it takes to poll the Wikipedia, but it doesn’t reduce the work. Another obvious way in which we could improve the scalability of the system is to add a push mechanism to supplement the pull mechanism. Instead of going out and polling the Wikipedia 65 million times, we could establish a &#8220;scholarly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback\" target=\"_blank\">linkback</a>” mechanism that would allow third parties to alert us when DOIs and other scholarly identifiers are referenced (e.g. cited, bookmarked, shared). If the Wikipedia used this, then even in an extreme case scenario (i.e. everything in Wikipedia cites at least one Crossref DOI), this would mean that we would only need to process ~ 4 million trackbacks.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >The other significant advantage of adding a push API is that it would take the burden off of Crossref to know what sources we want to poll. At the moment, if a new source comes online, we’d need to know about it and build a custom plugin to poll their data. This needlessly disadvantages new tools and services as it means that their data will not be gathered until they are big enough for us to pay attention to. If the service in question addresses a niche of the scholarly ecosystem, they may never become big enough. But if we allow sources to push data to us using a common infrastructure, then new sources do not need to wait for us to take notice before they can participate in the system.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >Supporting (potentially) many new sources will raise another technical issue- tracking and maintaining the provenance of the data that we gather. The current ALM system does a pretty good job of keeping data, but if we ever want third parties to be able to rely on the system, we probably need to extend the provenance information so that the data is cheaply and easily auditable.</span>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >Perhaps the most important thing we want to learn from running this experimental ALM instance is: what it would take to run the system as a production service? What technical resources would it require? How could they be supported? And from this we hope to gain enough information to decide whether the service is worth running and, if so, by whom. Crossref is just one of several organizations that could run such a service, but it is not clear if it would be the best one. We hope that as we work with PLOS, our members and the rest of the scholarly community, we’ll get a better idea of how such a service should be governed and sustained.</span>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"details\"><span >Details for Propellerheads</span></h2>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >Warning, Caveats and Weasel Words</span>\n</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span >The Crossref ALM instance is a <a href=\"http://labs.crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref Labs</a> project.

The truth is, the DOI has nothing specifically to do with citation or scholarly publishing. It is simply an identifier that can be used for virtually any application. DOIs could be used as serial numbers on car parts, as supply-chain management identifiers for videos and music or as cataloguing numbers for museum artifacts. The first two identifiers listed in the examples <strong>(a &amp; b)</strong> illustrate this. They both belong to <a href=\"http://www.movielabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MovieLabs</a> and are part of the <a href=\"http://eidr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EIDR</a> (Entertainment Identifier Registry) effort to create a unique identifier for television and movie assets. At the moment, the DOIs that MoveLabs are assigning are B2B-focused and users are unlikely to see them in the wild. But we should recall that Crossref’s application of DOIs was also initially considered a B2B identifier- but it has since become widely recognized and depended on by researchers, librarians and third parties. The visibility of EIDR DOIs could change rapidly as they become more popular.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-multiple-dois-can-be-assigned-to-the-same-objectspan\"><span >Multiple DOIs can be assigned to the same object</span></h2>\n<p><span >There is no <a href=\"http://www.doi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">International DOI Foundation</a> (IDF) prohibition against assigning multiple DOIs to the same object. At most the IDF suggests that RAs might coordinate to avoid duplicate assignments, but it provides no guidelines on how such cross-RA checks would work.</span></p>\n<p><span >Crossref, in its particular application of the DOI, attempts to ensure that we don’t assign two different copies of the same article with different DOIs, but that is designed in order to avoid having publishers mistakenly making duplicate submissions. Even then, there are subtle exceptions to this rule- the same article, if legitimately published in two different issues (e.g. a regular issue and a thematic issue) will be assigned different DOIs. This is because, though the actual article content might be identical, the <em>context</em> in which it is cited is also important to record and distinguish. Finally, of course, we assign multiple DOIs to the same “object” when we assign book-level and chapter level DOIs. Or when we assign DOIs to components or reference work entries.</span></p>\n<p><span >The likelihood of multiple DOIs being assigned to the same object increases as we have multiple RAs. In the future we might legitimately have a monograph that has different <a href=\"http://www.bowker.co.uk/en-UK/\" target=\"_blank\">Bowker</a> DOIs for different e-book platforms (Kindle, iPad, Kobo.) yet all three might share the same Crossref DOI for citation purposes.</span></p>\n<p><span >Again, the examples show this already happening. The examples <strong>f &amp; g</strong> are assigned by <a href=\"http://www.datacite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DataCite</a> (via <a href=\"http://figshare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FigShare</a>) and Crossref respectively. The first identifies the author version and was presumably assigned by said author. The second identifies the publisher version and was assigned by the publisher.</span></p>\n<p><span >Although Crossref, as a publisher-focused RA, might have historically proscribed the assignment of Crossref DOIs to archive or author versions, there has never been and could never be any such restrictions on other DOI RAs. These are legitimate applications of two citation identifiers to two versions of the same article.</span></p>\n<p><span >However, the next set of examples, <strong>h, i, j</strong> and <strong>k</strong> show what appears to be a slightly different problem. In these cases articles that appear to be in all aspects <em>identical</em> have been assigned two separate DOIs by different RAs. In one respect this is a logistical or technical problem- although Crossref can check for such potential duplicate assignments within its own system, there is no way for us to do this across different RAs. But this is also a marketing and education problem- how do RAs with similar constituencies (publishers, researchers, librarians) and application of the DOI (scholarly citation) educate and inform their members about best practice in applying DOIs in that particular RAs context?</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-doi-registration-agencies-are-not-focused-on-content-types-they-are-focused-on-constituencies-and-applicationsspan\"><span >DOI registration agencies are not focused on content types, they are focused on constituencies and applications</span></h2>\n<p><span >The examples <strong>f</strong> through <strong>k</strong> also illustrate another area of fuzzy thinking about RAs- that they are somehow built around particular content types. We routinely hear people mistakenly explain that difference between Crossref and DataCite is that “Crossref assigns DOIs to journal articles” and that “DataCite assigns DOIs to data.” Sometimes this is supplemented with “and Bowker assigns DOIs to books.” This is nonsense. Crossref assigns DOIs to data (example <strong>o</strong>) as well as conference proceedings, programs, images, tables, books, chapters, reference entries, etc. And DataCite covers a similar breadth of content types including articles (examples <strong>c, h, f, l, m</strong> ). The difference between Crossref, DataCite and Bowker is their constituencies and applications- not the content types they apply DOIs to. Crossref’s constituency is publishers. DataCite’s constituency is data repositories, archives and national libraries. But even though Crossref and DataCite have different constituencies, they share a similar application of the DOI- that is the use of DOI as citation identifiers. This is in contrast to MovieLabs whose application of the DOI is supply chain management.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-doi-registration-agency-constituencies-and-applications-can-overlap-or-be-entirely-separatespan\"><span >DOI registration agency constituencies and applications can overlap <em>or</em> be entirely separate</span></h2>\n<p><span >Although Crossref’s constituency is “publishers”, we are catholic in our definition of “publisher” and have several members who run repositories that also “publish” content such as working papers and other grey literature (e.g. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Michigan Library, University of Illinois Library). DataCite’s constituency is data repositories, archives and national libraries, but this doesn’t stop DataCite (through CDL/FigShare) from working with the publisher, PLoS, on their “<a href=\"http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2012/08/14/plos-one-launches-reproducibility-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\">Reproducibility Initiative</a>” which requires the archiving of article-related datasets. PloS has announced that they will host all supplemental data sets on FigShare but will assign DOIs to those items through Crossref.</span></p>\n<p><span >Crossref’s constituency of publishers overlaps heavily with <a href=\"http://doi.airiti.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Airiti</a>, <a href=\"http://japanlinkcenter.org/jalc/\" target=\"_blank\">JaLC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.medra.org/\" target=\"_blank\">mEDRA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.doi.org.cn/portal/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ISTIC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bowker.co.uk/en-UK/\" target=\"_blank\">Bowker</a>. In the case of all but Bowker we also overlap in our application of the DOI in the service of citation identification. Bowker, though it shares Crossref’s constituency, uses DOIs for supply chain management applications.</span></p>\n<p><span >Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://eidr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EIDR</a> is an outlier, its constituency does not overlap with Crossref’s <em>and</em> its application of the DOI is different as well.</span></p>\n<p><span >The relationship between RA constituency overlap (e.g. scholarly publishers vs television/movie studios) and application overlap (e.g. citation identification vs. supply chain management) can be visualized as such:</span></p>\n<p><span ><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2013/06/ra_overlap.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-280\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2013/06/ra_overlap.png\" alt=\"RA Application/Constituency overlap\" width=\"602\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2013/06/ra_overlap.png 602w, https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2013/06/ra_overlap-300x225.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span >The differences (subtle or large) between the various RAs are not evident to anybody without a fairly sophisticated understanding of the identifier space and the constituencies represented by the various RAs. To the ordinary person these are all just DOIs, which in turn are described as simply being “persistent interoperable identifiers.”</span></p>\n<p><span >Which of course begs the question, what do we mean by “persistent” and “interoperable?”</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-dois-only-are-as-persistent-as-the-registration-agencys-application-warrantsspan\"><span >DOIs only are as persistent as the registration agency’s application warrants.</span></h2>\n<p><span >The word “persistent” does not mean “permanent.” <a href=\"http://andrew.treloar.net/\">Andrew Treloar</a> is known to point out that the primary sense of the word “persistent” in the New Oxford American Dictionary is:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >Continuing firmly or obstinately in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >Yet presumably the IDF once chose to use the word “persistent” instead of “perpetual” or “permanent” for other reasons. “Persistence” implies longevity, without committing to “forever.”</span></p>\n<p><span >It may sound prissy, but it seems reasonable to expect that the useful life-expectancy for the identifier used for managing inventory of the the movie “Young Sex Crazed Nurses” might be different than the life expectancy for the identifier used to cite Henry Oldenburg’s “Epistle Dedicatory” in the first issue of the Philosophical Transactions. In other words, some RAs have a mandate to be more “obstinate” than others and so their definitions of “persistence” may vary. Different RAs have different service level agreements.</span></p>\n<p><span >The problem is that ordinary users of the “persistent” DOI have no way of distinguishing between those DOIs that are expected to have a useful life of 5 years and those DOIs that are expected to have a useful lifespan of 300+ years. Unfortunately, if one of the more than 6 million non-Crossref DOIs breaks today, it will likely be blamed on Crossref.</span></p>\n<p><span >Similarly, if a DOI doesn’t work with an existing Crossref service, like CrossCheck, Crossmark or Crossref Metadata Search, it will also be laid at the foot of Crossref. This scenario is likely to become even more complex as different RAs provide different specialized services for their constituencies.</span></p>\n<p><span >Ironically, the converse doesn’t always apply. Crossref oftentimes does not get credit for services that we instigated at the IDF level. For instance, FigShare has been widely praised for implementing content negotiation for DOIs even though this initiative had nothing to do with FigShare, instead it was implemented by DataCite with the prodding and active help of Crossref (DataCite even used Crossref’s code for a while). To be clear, we don’t begrudge praise for FigShare. We think FigShare is very cool- this just serves as an example of the confusion that is already occurring.</span></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/uploads/2013/06/impressed.png\"\nalt=\"screenshot of tweet by Leigh Dodds\" width=\"595\" height=\"210\"/>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"heading\"></h2>\n<h2 id=\"span-dois-are-only-interoperable-at-a-least-common-denominator-level-of-functionalityspan\"><span >DOIs are only “interoperable” at a least common denominator level of functionality</span></h2>\n<p><span >There is no question that use of Crossref DOIs has enabled the interoperability of citations across scholarly publisher sites. The extra level of indirection built into the DOI means that publishers do not have to worry about negotiating multiple bilateral linking agreements and proprietary APIs. Furthermore, at the mundane technical level of following HTTP links, publishers also don’t have to worry about whether the DOI was registered with mEDRA, DataCite or Crossref as long as the DOI in question was applied with citation linking in mind.</span></p>\n<p><span >However, what happens if somebody wants to use metadata to search for a particular DOI? What happens if they expect that DOI to work with content negotiation or to enable a CrossCheck analysis or show a Crossmark dialog or carry <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\" target=\"_blank\">FundRef</a> data? At this level, the purported interoperability of the DOI system falls apart. A publisher issuing DataCite DOIs cannot use CrossCheck. A user with a mEDRA DOI cannot use it with content negotiation. Somebody searching Crossref Metadata Search or using Crossref’s OpenURL API will not find DataCite records. Somebody depositing metadata in an RA other than Crossref or DataCite will not be able to deposit ORCIDs.</span></p>\n<p><span >There are no easy or cheap technical solutions to fix this level of incompatibility baring the creation of a superset of all RA functionality at the IDF level. But even if we had a technical solution to this problem- it isn’t clear that such a high-level of interoperability is warranted across all RAs. The degree of interoperability that is desirable between RAs is only in proportion to the degree that they serve overlapping constituencies (e.g. publishers) or use the DOI for overlapping applications (e.g. citation)</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-doi-interoperability-matters-more-for-some-registration-agencies-than-othersspan\"><span >DOI Interoperability matters more for some registration agencies than others</span></h2>\n<p><span >This raises the question of what it even means to be “interoperable” between different RAs that share virtually no overlap in constituencies or applications. In what meaningful sense do you make a DOI used for inventory control “interoperable” with a DOI used for identifying citable scholarly works? Do we want to be able to check “Young Sex Crazed Nurses” for plagiarism? Or let somebody know when the South Park movie has been retracted or updated? Do we need to alert somebody when their inventory of citations falls below a certain threshold? Or let them know how many copies of a PDF are left in the warehouse?</span></p>\n<p><span >The opposite, but equally vexing issue arrises for RAs that actually share constituencies and/or applications. Crossref, DataCIte and mEDRA have <em>all</em> built separate metadata search capabilities, separate deposit APIs, separate OpenURL APIs, and separate stats packages- <em>all</em> geared at handling scholarly citation linking.</span></p>\n<p><span >Finally, it seems a shame that a third party, like ORCID, who wants to enable researchers to add <em>any</em> DOI and its associated metadata to their ORCID profile, will end up having to interface with 4-5 different RAs.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"span-summary-and-closing-thoughtsspan\"><span >Summary and closing thoughts</span></h2>\n<p><span >Crossref was founded by publishers who were prescient in understanding that, as scholarly content moved online, there was the potential to add great value to publications by directly linking citations to the documents cited. However, publishers also realized that many of the architectural attributes that made the WWW so successful (decentralization, simple protocols for markup, linking and display, etc.), also made the web a fragile platform for persistent citation.</span></p>\n<p><span >The Crossref solution to this dilemma was to introduce the use of the DOI identifier as a level of citation indirection in order to layer a persist-able citation infrastructure onto the web. The success of this mechanism has been evident at a number of levels. A first-order effect of the system is that it has allowed publishers to create reliable and persistent links between copies of publisher content. Indeed uptake of the Crossref system by scholarly and professional publishers has been rapid and almost all serious scholarly publishers are now Crossref members.</span></p>\n<p><span >The second order effects of the Crossref system have also been remarkable. Firstly, just as researchers have long expected that any serious paper-based publication would include citations, now researchers expect that serious online scholarly publications will also support robust online citation linking. Secondly, some have adopted a cargo-cult practice of seeing the mere presence of a DOI on a publication as a putative sign of “citability” or “authority.” Thirdly, interest in use of the DOI as a linking mechanism has started to filter out to researchers themselves, thus potentially extending the use of Crossref DOIs beyond being primarily a B2B citation convention.</span></p>\n<p><span >The irony is that although the DOI system was almost single-handedly popularized and promoted by Crossref, the DOI brand is better known than Crossref itself. We now find that new RAs like EIDR, DataCite and new services like FigShare are building on the DOI brand and taking it in new directions. As such the first and second order benefits of Crossref’s pioneering work with DOIs are likely to be effected by the increasing activity of the new DOI RAs as well as the introduction of new models for assigning and maintaining DOIs.</span></p>\n<p><span >How can you trust that a DOI is persistent if different RAs have different conceptions of persistence? How can you expect the presence of a DOI to indicate “authority” or “scholarliness” if DOIs are being assigned to porn movies? How can you expect a DOI to point to the “published” version of an article when authors can upload and assign DOIs to their own copies of articles?</span></p>\n<p><span >It is precisely because we think that some of the qualities traditionally (and wrongly) accorded to DOIs (e.g. scholarly, published, stewarded, citable, persistent) are going to be diluted in the long term that we have focused so much of our recent attention on new initiatives that have a more direct and unambiguous connection to assessing the trustworthiness of Crossref member’s content. CrossCheck and the CrossCheck logos are designed to highlight the role that publishers play in detecting and preventing academic fraud. The Crossmark identification service will serve as a signal to researchers that publishers are committed to maintaining their scholarly content as well as giving scholars the information they need to verify that they are using the most recent and reliable versions of a document. FundRef is designed to make the funding sources for research and articles transparent and easily accessible. And finally we have been both adjusting Crossref’s branding and display guidelines as well as working with the IDF to refine its branding and display guidelines so as to help clearly differentiate different DOI applications and constituencies.</span></p>\n<p><span >Whilst it might be worrying to some that DOIs are being applied in ways that Crossref has not expected and may not have historically endorsed, we should celebrate that the broader scholarly community is finally recognizing the importance of persist-able citation identifiers.</span></p>\n<p><span >These developments also serve to reinforce a strong trend that we have encountered in several guises before. That is, the complete scholarly citation record is made up of more than citations to the formally published literature. Our work on <a href=\"http://www.orcid.org\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID</a> underscored that researchers, funding agencies, institutions and publishers are interested in developing a more holistic view of the manifold contributions that are integral to research. The “C” in ORCID stands for “contributor” and ORCID profiles are designed to ultimately allow researchers to record “products” which include not only formal publications, but also data sets, patents, software, web pages and other research outputs. Similarly, Crossref’s analysis of the CitedBy references revealed that one in fifteen references in the scholarly literature published in 2012 included a plain, ordinary HTTP URI- clear evidence that researchers need to be able to cite informally published content on the web. If the trend in CitedBy data continues, then in two to three years one in ten citations will be of informally published literature.</span></p>\n<p><span >The developments that we are seeing are a response to the need that users have to persistently identify and cite the full gamut of content types that make up the scholarly literature. If we can not persistently site these content types, the scholarly citation record will grow increasingly porous and structurally unsound.  We can either stand back and let these gaps be filled by other players under their terms and deal reactively with the confusion that is likely to ensue- or we can start working in these areas too and help to make sure that what gets developed interacts with the existing online scholarly citation record in a responsible way.</span></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Easily add publications to your ORCID profile","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/easily-add-publications-to-your-orcid-profile/","published":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000","description":"You can now easily search for publications and add them to your ORCID profile in the new beta of Crossref Metadata Search (CRMDS).

When you input a DOI into the formatting service, it doesn’t know where the DOI was registered. The service will make an</p>\n<p>HTTP content negotiation request to the global DOI resolver specifying which format of the metadata should be returned in the HTTP Accept header. The global DOI resolver will notice (Accept header!) that this is not a regular DOI resolution request; it will turn to Crossref or DataCite accordingly for the relevant metadata instead of redirecting to a landing page. The format of metadata is shared between both registration agencies so the formatting service can interpret it without knowledge of the DOI origin.</p>\n<p>In summary HTTP content negotiation lets you process a DOI’s metadata without knowledge of its origin or specifics of the registration agency.</p>\n<p>If you have any problems, email us at\n<a href=\"mailto:tech@datacite.org\">tech@datacite.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:labs@crossref.org\">labs@crossref.org</a>.

The aim is to show that these two modes of search do not have to be alternative approaches but can co-exist within a single workflow.</p>\n<p>Let me first mention a couple of terms I’m using here: ‘graphs’ and ‘properties’. I’m using ‘property’ loosely to refer to the individual RDF statement (or triple) containing a property, i.e. a triple is a ‘(subject, property, value)’ assertion. And a ‘graph’ is just a collection of ‘properties’ (or, more properly, triples). Oh, and I’ll also use the term ‘records’ when considering ‘graphs’ as pre-fabricated objects returned within a result set.</p>\n<p>So, what do we have here? We have on the left a traditional means of disseminating search results which is typically record based. A new set of records may be generated by querying using the API provided, whether proprietary or public such as <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucene</a> or <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/\" target=\"_blank\">SRU/CQL</a>. We can thus consider this search service as a ‘record store’ – even though records tend to generated anew rather than retrieved. The individual records in the result set are collections or groupings of ‘properties’ about the subjects of the query. Note that this is somewhat similar to the way music is packaged for physical distribution with many tracks (‘properties’) combined onto a single album (‘record’ or ‘graph’) which contains a thematic coherence – either same artist or compilation around a given topic.</p>\n<p>Digital music distribution, on the other hand, allows for albums to be atomized so that individual tracks may be cherry-picked at will. This is not dissimilar from what happens in a ‘triple store’ where the basic properties (‘tracks’) that in a regular search engine were together combined in a ‘record’ (‘album’) to present a search result can now be plucked apart and recombined into newer bespoke ensembles. Note that this querying and recombination can be applied across the full triple store or even across this triple store and remote triple stores since the same data model is applied. Certainly, at the data model level federated searching thus becomes a non-issue.</p>\n<p>Suppose now that our search server (or record store) is an <a href=\"http://www.opensearch.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenSearch</a>-type service, i.e. the result sets are distributed as some list-based format, typically RSS, and that the list-based format either provides an RDF graph or can be transformed to such a graph, we could then use that as a basis for feeding an RDF triple store.</p>\n<p>So, now then at right we have a triple store which is a large database of triples (or properties) compiled from all the records in the record store. And since this is a triple store we can query it using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/\" target=\"_blank\">SPARQL</a>. For example, this trival SPARQL query:</p>\n<pre><tt>\nPREFIX dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;\nPREFIX prism: &lt;http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/&gt;\nSELECT ?doi ?title\nWHERE {\n?s prism:doi ?doi .\n?s dc:title ?title .\nFILTER regex(?title, \"boson\", \"i\" )\n}\nLIMIT 5\n</tt></pre>\n<p>returns the first five articles (referenced by DOI) with title containing the word ‘boson’:</p>\n<pre><tt>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| doi | title |\n==================================================================================================\n| \"10.1038/nature05513\" | \"Comparison of the Hanbury Brown–Twiss effect for bosons and fermions\" |\n| \"10.1038/221999a0\" | \"Physics: The Intermediate Boson\" |\n| \"10.1038/313506b0\" | \"The nuts and bolts of bosons\" |\n| \"10.1038/301287a0\" | \"The search for bosons: A golden year for the weak force\" |\n| \"10.1038/424003a\" | \"Below-par performance hampers Fermilab quest for Higgs boson\" |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</tt></pre>\n<p>Now let’s contrast this with a conventional record-based search, such as shown at left, to find the first five articles (referenced by DOI) with title containing the word ‘boson’ would use a query (here SRU/CQL, and CQL is bolded) such as:</p>\n<pre><tt>\n?query=<b>dc.title=\"boson\"</b>&maximumRecords=5&httpAccept=application/rss+xml\n</tt></pre>\n<p>and would receive a set of result records (here RSS) like so:</p>\n<pre><tt>\n...\n&lt;item rdf:about=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05513\"&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Comparison of the Hanbury Brown–Twiss effect for bosons and fermions&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;link&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05513&lt;/link&gt;\n&lt;dc:identifier&gt;doi:10.1038/nature05513&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;\n&lt;dc:title&gt;Comparison of the Hanbury Brown–Twiss effect for bosons and fermions&lt;/dc:title&gt;\n...\n&lt;/item&gt;\n&lt;item rdf:about=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/221999a0\"&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Physics: The Intermediate Boson&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;link&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/221999a0&lt;/link&gt;\n&lt;dc:identifier&gt;doi:10.1038/221999a0&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;\n&lt;dc:title&gt;Physics: The Intermediate Boson&lt;/dc:title&gt;\n...\n&lt;/item&gt;\n...\n</tt></pre>\n<p>Note also that there is an interesting halfway house as shown in the diagram, whereby a set of result records presenting a single RDF graph can be queried as its own (very) restricted triple store.</p>\n<p>In general, because a triple store is so primitive and it can be queried alongside other triple stores the queries that can be put together can be highly complex and customized with arbitrary data. The result from such a query differs from a traditional ‘record’ where a fixed property set is bound together in a presentation. Such a result is user-determined as opposed to the server-determined nature of traditional result ‘records’.</p>\n<p>I hope that this post has been able to show in some degree that although there are some obvious differences there is nevertheless a synergy between these two modes of searching: prêt-à-porter and tailored.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"DOIs and Linked Data: Some Concrete Proposals","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/dois-and-linked-data-some-concrete-proposals/","published":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Since last month’s threads (here, here, here and here) talking about the issues involved in making the DOI a first-class identifier for linked data applications, I’ve had the chance to actually sit down with...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey Bilder","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>Since last month’s threads (<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/doi-what-do-we-got/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-response-page/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/does-a-crossref-doi-identify-a-work/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/is-frbr-the-osi-for-web-architecture/\">here</a>) talking about the issues involved in making the DOI a first-class identifier for linked data applications, I’ve had the chance to actually sit down with some of the thread’s participants (<a href=\"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/tonyhammond\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Hammond</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ldodds.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh Dodds</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100525232458/http://www.tertius.ltd.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Norman Paskin</a>) and we’ve been able sketch-out some possible scenarios for migrating the DOI into a linked data world.</p>\n<p>I think that several of us were struck by how little actually needs to be done in order to fully address virtually all of the concerns that the linked data community has expressed about DOIs.

(Hell, it’s there, as you point out, in the organization name - PILA - as well as in the application name - Crossref.)</p>\n<p>But one should also remember that DOI as it was sold at the time was promising so much more. I disagree with you that the participants back then were as wholly innocent of the FRBR terms as you might suggest. Certainly there were ample presentations on DOI that sought to elucidate those relationships.</p>\n<p>No matter. FRBR is a useful reference model to clarify some of these concepts. But not one that we are overly concerned with at this time. Nor even whether DOI maps one to one onto a given FRBR layer. What we are more concerned with on a pragmatic level is how DOI maps onto the Web architecture and especially how it plays along with Linked Data concepts.</p>\n<p>(Aside: A propos FRBR we might be in danger of repeating the OSI mistake for standardizing the network layer model. Ultimately that was maintained as a reference model but dropped as a concrete model in favour of the TCP/IP stack. Could be that FRBR is our OSI and Linked Data is our TCP/IP stack? That is, we might have to settle on the coarser data model in order to get a coherent story out the door where all can agree.)</p>\n<p>You say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“we need a mechanism to distinguish between when we are getting the thing pointed to by the Crossref DOI (the PDF , HTML, etc.) as opposed to “something about the thing” (e.g. the landing page, metadata record, etc.)”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But that is exactly what we were chasing up in the earlier posts (both my <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/doi-what-do-we-got/\">DOI: What Do We Got?</a> and John Erickson’s <a href=\"http://bitwacker.wordpress.com/2010/02/04/dois-uris-and-cool-resolution/\" target=\"_blank\">DOIs, URIs and Cool Resolution</a>). You want to distinguish between a thing and a description about a thing. And Web architecture does just that: it distinguishes between Information Resources (i.e. the things) and Non-Information Resources (i.e. descriptions of the things).</p>\n<p>Now is this something that Crossref can truly distinguish and make apparent in its service architecture? If we retain the notion of landing page we are already essentially saying that a Crossref HTTP URI identifies a decsription of the resource, i.e. a Non-Information Resource, or Other Resource, and that is properly indicated within the architecture by returning a “303 See Other status” code.</p>\n<p>I think that’s all we’re saying at the moment as a first step.</p>\n<p>Web architecture wants to know if the DOI HTTP URI is a thing or description of a thing. I say the latter. You seem to suggest in your comment the latter too. I wonder if we could get a vote on that.</p>\n<p>And btw, I am not suggesting that Crossref needs to dive into the business of <em>“tracking compoend documents in their entirety”</em>. Far from it. Lets just get a common resource architecture agreed publicly and then we can build on that.</p>\n<p>This observation I received in a private email is something I fully support:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“The real problem is what doi http uri identify on the web. Everything flows from the answer to that Q.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tony</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Does a Crossref DOI identify a \"work?\"","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/does-a-crossref-doi-identify-a-work/","published":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Tony’s recent thread on making DOIs play nicely in a linked data world has raised an issue I’ve meant to discuss here for some time- a lot of the thread is predicated on the idea that Crossref DOIs are...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey Bilder","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>Tony’s recent thread on <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/doi-what-do-we-got/\">making DOIs play nicely in a linked data world</a> has raised an issue I’ve meant to discuss here for some time- a lot of the thread is predicated on the idea that Crossref DOIs are applied at the abstract “work” level. Indeed, that it what it currently says in our guidelines. Unfortunately, this is a case where theory, practice and documentation all diverge.</p>\n<p>When the Crossref linking system was developed it was focused primarily on facilitating persistent linking amongst journals and conference proceedings. The system was quickly adapted to handle books and more recently to handle working papers, technical reports, standards and “components”- a catchall term used to refer to everything from individual article images to database records.</p>\n<p>In practice the content outside of the core journals and conference proceedings has accounted for relatively low volume. However, we expect that over the next few years this will change and that books and databases will increasingly drive the future growth in Crossref’s citation linking services. Interestingly, these content types all share characteristics that make them substantially different from the journals and conference proceedings that we have hitherto focused on.</p>\n<p>Both books and databases introduce new challenges to technology and policies of our citation linking service. The challenges revolved around two areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Structure: Both books and databases can have complex structures and the publishers of this content are likely to require granular identification of these content substructures along with a mechanism for documenting the relationship between these substructures (e.g. this section is part of this chapter which is part of this monograph which is part of this series)</li>\n<li>Versioning: Unlike typical journals and conference proceedings, books and database records sometimes change over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When confronted with the issues of structure and versioning publishers are often tempted to take shortcuts and decide to simply assign DOIs at the highest level structure and to the “work” instead of a particular “manifestation” or version of that work. Indeed, section 5.5 of Crossref’s [DOI Name Information and Guidelines][2] recommends this. But this approach could have a negative impact on the integrity of the scholarly citation record that Crossref is attempting to maintain.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, Crossref DOIs are aimed at providing a persistent online citation infrastructure for scholarly and professional publishers. Consequently, decisions about where to apply Crossref DOIs should be guided by common expectations about the way in which citations work. Citations are typically used to credit ideas or provide evidence. A reader follows a citation in order to obtain more detail or to verify that an author is accurately representing the item cited. A rule of thumb is that a reader has a reasonable expectation that when they follow a citation, they will be taken to what the author saw when creating the citation. Any divergent behavior could result in the reader concluding that the author was misrepresenting the item cited. A further implication of this is that any changes to content that are likely to effect the crediting or interpretation of the content should result in that changed content getting a new Crossref DOI.</p>\n<p>Typically, this means that Crossref DOIs should be probably assigned at the expression level and different expressions should be assigned different Crossref DOIs. This is because assigning a Crossref DOI at the higher “work” level is generally not granular enough to guarantee that a reader following the citation will see what the author saw when creating the citation. For example, one translation of a work might be substantially different from another translation of the same work. Similarly a draft version of a work might be substantially different from the final published version of the work. In each case, resolving a citation to a different expression of the work than the expression that was originally cited might result in the reader interpreting the content differently than the citing author.</p>\n<p>In general, different “equivalent manifestations” of the same work can safely be assigned the same Crossref DOI. So, for instance, the HTML formatted version an article and the PDF formatted version of an article can almost always be assigned the same Crossref DOI. Any differences between the two are unlikely to affect the crediting of, or reader’s interpretation of, the work. But sometimes it is even possible that different manifestations of an expression will differ enough to merit different Crossref DOIs. For instance, a semantically enhanced version of an article might require new crediting (e.g. the parties responsible for adding the semantic information) and the resulting semantic enhancement may conceivably alter the reader’s interpretation of the article.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule about where and when to assign new Crossref DOIs. Instead there is only a guideline, namely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Assign new Crossref DOIs to content in a way that will ensure that a reader following the citation will see something as close to what the original author cited as is possible.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The implications of this to publishers are important, especially when they are assigning DOIs to protean content types. For instance, it may mean that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Book publishers should be expected to keep old editions of books available for link resolution purposes.</li>\n<li>Publishers of content that can change rapidly (e.g. by the second) should provide facilities for creating frozen, archived snapshots of content for citation purposes.</li>\n<li>All publishers of protean content should issue guidelines instructing researchers on when it is appropriate to cite a work, manifestation or version.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crossref needs to actively consider these issues as publishers start assigning Crossref DOIs to more dynamic types of content. Minimally, we should be able to provide publishers with recommendations on how to make dynamic content citable. We may even want to consider enshrining certain types of behavior in our terms and conditions so as to ensure the future integrity of the scholarly citation record.</p>\n<p>In short, we need to update our guidelines.</p>\n<p>[2]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/5jchdy\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref DOI display guidelines</a></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"The Response Page","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-response-page/","published":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000","description":"(Update - 2010.02.10: I just saw that I posted here on this same topic over a year ago.

This is the raw DOI number. (This definitely is not a first class object on the Web as it has no URI.)\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Web Data</strong> - An online information context (here I use the term ‘Web’ in its widest sense) where resources are identified by URI (not necessarily an HTTP URI). Here DOI is represented under two URI schemes: ‘doi:’ (unregistered but preferred by Crossref), and ‘info:’ (registered and available for general URI use). Also it has a presence on the Web via an HTTP proxy (dx.doi.org) URL where it is used as a slug to create a permalink (as listed at ‘A’). A simple HTTP redirect is used (with status code 302) to turn this permalink into the publisher response page http://example/1. (Note that typically a second redirect will occur on the publisher platform, here shown by the redirect to http://example/2.)\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Linked Data</strong> - An online information context where resources are identified by HTTP URI and conform to Linked Data principles. Now this is where there is a tension arises between the common publisher perspective and the strict semantic viewpoint. Implicit in the general Web context given above was the notion that the permalink (‘A’) was somehow related to the abstract object and the redirection service applied to it associated the abstract resource with concrete representations of the object.</ol>\nSo how do we relate the DOI HTTP URI with the abstract (‘work’) identifier listed at ‘D’ in the diagram?</p>\n<p>Well the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\" target=\"_blank\">Architecture of the World Wide Web</a> recognizes two distinct classes of resources: Information Resources (IR) and Non-Information Resources (NR). (Note: Only the term ‘information resource’ is used in AWWW.) IR are those that can be directly retrieved using HTTP, whereas NR are not directly retrievable but have an associated description which is retrievable and is itself a proxy for the real world object.</p>\n<p>So either the HTTP URI denotes an IR (as listed at ‘B’) and is resolved (through HTTP status code ‘302 Found’) to a default representation, which is the view that the Linked Data community would currently have of DOI. But this is at odds with what the Crossref position which regards DOI as identifying the abstract work. Alternately to fit better the Crossref model of DOI the HTTP URI would denote an NR (as listed at ‘A’) which would be resolved (through HTTP status code ‘303 See Other’) to an associated description - a publisher response page.</p>\n<p>There will be those self-appointed URI czars who will bemoan the fact of there being multiple URIs. But frankly there is nothing inherently wrong with that. Just as in the real world there are many languages so in the online world there are multiple contexts and histories. We can attempt to make some sense of this by making use of the well-known semantic properties <code>owl:sameAs</code> and <code>ore:similarTo</code> and declare (as also shown in the diagram) the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>``<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/images/doi-what-do-we-got.png\"><img border=0 alt=\"doi-what-do-we-got.png\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/images/doi-what-do-we-got.png\" width=\"467\" height=\"323\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Click image for full size graphic.)</p>\n<p>Following the JISC seminar last week on persistent identifiers (<code>#jiscpid</code> on Twitter) there was some discussion about DOI and its role within a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100413223720/http://linkeddata.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Data</a> context.

(This definitely is not a first class object on the Web as it has no URI.)\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Web Data</strong> - An online information context (here I use the term ‘Web’ in its widest sense) where resources are identified by URI (not necessarily an HTTP URI). Here DOI is represented under two URI schemes: ‘doi:’ (unregistered but preferred by Crossref), and ‘info:’ (registered and available for general URI use). Also it has a presence on the Web via an HTTP proxy (dx.doi.org) URL where it is used as a slug to create a permalink (as listed at ‘A’). A simple HTTP redirect is used (with status code 302) to turn this permalink into the publisher response page http://example/1. (Note that typically a second redirect will occur on the publisher platform, here shown by the redirect to http://example/2.)\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Linked Data</strong> - An online information context where resources are identified by HTTP URI and conform to Linked Data principles. Now this is where there is a tension arises between the common publisher perspective and the strict semantic viewpoint. Implicit in the general Web context given above was the notion that the permalink (‘A’) was somehow related to the abstract object and the redirection service applied to it associated the abstract resource with concrete representations of the object.</ol>\nSo how do we relate the DOI HTTP URI with the abstract (‘work’) identifier listed at ‘D’ in the diagram?</p>\n<p>Well the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\" target=\"_blank\">Architecture of the World Wide Web</a> recognizes two distinct classes of resources: Information Resources (IR) and Non-Information Resources (NR). (Note: Only the term ‘information resource’ is used in AWWW.) IR are those that can be directly retrieved using HTTP, whereas NR are not directly retrievable but have an associated description which is retrievable and is itself a proxy for the real world object.</p>\n<p>So either the HTTP URI denotes an IR (as listed at ‘B’) and is resolved (through HTTP status code ‘302 Found’) to a default representation, which is the view that the Linked Data community would currently have of DOI. But this is at odds with what the Crossref position which regards DOI as identifying the abstract work. Alternately to fit better the Crossref model of DOI the HTTP URI would denote an NR (as listed at ‘A’) which would be resolved (through HTTP status code ‘303 See Other’) to an associated description - a publisher response page.</p>\n<p>There will be those self-appointed URI czars who will bemoan the fact of there being multiple URIs. But frankly there is nothing inherently wrong with that. Just as in the real world there are many languages so in the online world there are multiple contexts and histories. We can attempt to make some sense of this by making use of the well-known semantic properties <code>owl:sameAs</code> and <code>ore:similarTo</code> and declare (as also shown in the diagram) the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>``</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that ore:similarTo (stemming from the <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/\" target=\"_blank\">OAI-ORE</a> work) is a weaker kind of relationship than owl:sameAs (which comes from <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/\" target=\"_blank\">OWL</a>) and may be appropriate in this usage.</p>\n<p>In sum, scenario ‘A’ is what we have currently implemented, scenario ‘B’ is what might be commonly perceived as being implemented, and scenario ‘C’ may be a more correct semantic position.</p>\n<p>Your comments (and not unkind comments, please;) are more than welcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>"},{"id":null,"title":"A Christmas Reading List… with DOIs","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-christmas-reading-list-with-dois/","published":"Sun, 13 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Was outraged (outraged, I tell you) that one of my favorite online comics, PhD, didn’t include DOIs in their recent bibliography of Christmas-related citations..

Note that the URL templates include no indexing or pagination parameters as the Crossref prototype does not currently support these features.</p>\n<p>An example query (‘apple’) returning an ATOM feed from a Crossref Metadata OpenSearch would be the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://nurture.nature.com/cgi-bin/opensearch?db=crossref&amp;#038;out=atom&amp;#038;q=apple\" target=\"_blank\">http://nurture.nature.com/cgi-bin/opensearch?db=crossref&#038;out=atom&#038;q=apple</a></ul>\nAnd the same query returning a JSON version of that ATOM feed would look as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://nurture.nature.com/cgi-bin/opensearch?db=crossref&amp;#038;out=json&amp;#038;q=apple\" target=\"_blank\">http://nurture.nature.com/cgi-bin/opensearch?db=crossref&#038;out=json&#038;q=apple</a></ul>\nBy the way, this is just for demonstration purposes and there are still issues to be resolved including character encoding.</p>\n<p>This interface uses the existing Crossref OpenSearch response format and parses the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090927174724/http://ocoins.info/\" target=\"_blank\">COinS</a> objects embedded in that response to provide a more standard OpenSearch syndication result set format. The prototype implemenatation also has some bugs which I needed to work around. (I will forward on details of these.) And there is also a more fundamental issue of response time from the experimental search server.</p>\n<p>But still this should give some idea of what a Crossref Metadata OpenSearch service could look like.</p>\n<p>To show this all in action I’ve worked up one of my <a href=\"http://nurture.nature.com/opensearch/apps/client-facets.html\" target=\"_blank\">demo OpenSearch clients</a> for <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/opensearch/\" target=\"_blank\">nature.com OpenSearch</a> which displays a facetted search response for a Crossref search. For good measure this includes also an OpenSearch interface for PubMed and the search client allows for simple selection between three journals databases: nature.com, Crossref and PubMed.</p>\n<p>Of course, with a reasonably uniform set of search result formats such as presented here it then becomes a simple exercise to reuse these search responses in additional search clients.</p>\n<p>As can be anticipated it would be very straightforward to carry this over into a single metasearch service which could run across these multiple databases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":null,"title":"A Cheatsheet for nature.com OpenSearch","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-cheatsheet-for-nature.com-opensearch/","published":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Following on from my recent post about our shiny new nature.com OpenSearch service we just put up a cheatsheet for users.

This is a topic that is close to my heart. For the past few years I’ve been saying (<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Crossref/itunes-for-scholarly-publishing\" target=\"_blank\">most recently at SSP09</a>) that I think scholarly publishers are much too quick to dismiss the possibility of creating an iTunes-like service for scholarly publications (aka “iPub”). The report certainly seems to indicate that there is an important audience that would benefit from such a service (SMEs) and even goes so far as to cite my occasional rants on the subject. The summary of my iPub argument has been that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A very large percentage of the web visits that hit publishers web sites come from sources that are unrecognised. That is, they don’t come from a subscribing institution and they don’t seem to come from a registered user or anybody who has visited the site previously. For many publishers the level of such unrecognised visitors can amount to over 90% of all the traffic that hits their sites. Most industries would look at this percentage and work hard to figure out how to monetize some of it. Our industry seems to treat it like “noise”, reasoning that only people in recognised academic and professional institutions are going to desire or understand the content on scholarly journal sites.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyrecentgrads/\" target=\"_blank\">Evidence from the NSF</a> shows that significantly more than 50% of US students who graduate with an S&amp;E degree end up employed outside of directly S&amp;E related fields. This represents a large percentage of potential consumers of scholarly and professional publications who are not part of a recognised academic or professional institution. SMEs anybody?</li>\n<li>These potential consumers are faced with a bewildering variety of sources for their content. They have to deal with multiple publisher sites with different interfaces and different PPV checkout procedures. And they have to navigate all this without the aid of library finding tools or the professional researcher’s understanding the scholarly journal environment. It is no wonder that they give up hope once they land on our abstract pages and face the gauntlet of another PPV checkout system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It seems to me that the industry could provide a single interface and PPV shopping cart interface targeted at allowing people who work outside of traditional subscribing institutions to easily purchase individual article downloads from scholarly publishers. The system would be modelled at least in part by Apple’s iTunes, a system that has been lauded (and denounced) for revolutionising the way in which consumers buy music online. The chief virtues of the iTunes system are often cited as being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It contains a critical mass of content</li>\n<li>It provides a simple and consistent user interface</li>\n<li>It has a simple and inexpensive pricing model</li>\n<li>It disaggregated content (per song purchases)</li>\n<li>It interfaced transparently with the iPod.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A scholarly publishing “iPub” system could seek to emulate many of these strengths but not all. Clearly such a system could not impose uniform pricing or dictate pricing, as that would be anti-competitive. The PRC report makes this same point.</p>\n<p>Some, including the PRC report, also claim that the publishing industry has no equivalent of the “iPod” and that this would be a weakness of the system. I don’t agree with this- I think that the “iPod” in this case is currently called “paper.” In the future we will almost certainly migrate to some iPod/Kindle-like device, but as far as fulfilling most of the iPod’s functionality (portable rendering of the content) right now, I suspect paper fits the bill.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a another oft-expressed concern that such a system might confuse channels for existing audiences and that librarians in particular would be very hostile to such a system. The truth is, I don’t know how librarians would react to such a system. The few I’ve mentioned it to certainly seemed amenable to the idea. Maybe this is where the PRC should do some follow-up research?</p>\n<p>In any case, it seems to me that there is potentially much to be gained by simply providing an easy PPV experience where users don’t have to register with multiple sites and cope with multiple shopping cart applications. Publishers can’t seriously think that they gain competitive advantage through their shopping carts? If not, then why not standardise on a uniform interface that is easily purchased from? Perhaps it doesn’t have to look like iTunes but can instead look like PayPal (PayPub?). Providing a simple mechanism like this might enable the industry to meet the needs of important and often overlooked audiences. I keep wondering if <a href=\"http://www.copyright.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CCC</a> could help publishers do something here?</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Crossref is hiring an R&D Developer in Oxford","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-is-hiring-an-rd-developer-in-oxford/","published":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000","description":"We are looking to hire an R&amp;D Developer in our Oxford offices.

It therefore allows for structured result sets while placing no constraints on the query string. As outlined in my earlier post <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/search-web-service\">Search Web Service</a>, there is support for search operation control parameters (pagination, encoding, etc.), but no inroads are made into the query string itself which is regarded as opaque.</p>\n<p>SRU by contrast is an initiative to update <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/\" target=\"_blank\">Z39.50</a> for the Web and is firmly focussed on structured queries and responses.

Result records are returned using any declared W3C XML Schema format and are transported within a defined XML wrapper format for SRU.

The <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/images/queryType.png\">diagram</a> at top of this post shows query forms for OpenSearch and SRU and associated result types. The Search Web Service is taken to be exposing an SRU interface. It might be simplest to walk through each of the cases.</p>\n<p>(Continues below.)</p>\n<p><em>Case 1: OpenSearch (Native Client)</em></p>\n<p>As noted, OpenSearch uses a URL template (declared in an OpenSearch description document) where recognized parameters are mapped to implementation-specific parameters. The bolded parameter “<strong>query</strong>” in the figure indicates an OpenSearch parameter “<strong>searchTerms</strong>” which has been mapped to the Search Web Service parameter “<strong>query</strong>“,</p>\n<p>As also noted, SRU 2.0 offers support for alternate result formats (other than SRU XML) by allowing a media type (aka mime type) to be passed in an “http:accept” parameter. There is, however, no OpenSearch parameter corresponding to a format selector, so this must be hard coded directly into the URL template with a value of “application/rss+xml” - the standard media type for an RSS feed which is the common result format for OpenSearch.</p>\n<p>(In the diagram I have noted in parentheses that RSS in its RSS 1.0 form is RDF. And that format is a strong candidate for semantic interoperability. An alternate format would be Atom, which could be similarly selected with a value of “application/atom+xml”, but it is difficult to see at this time what advantage Atom confers. It does not conform to the RDF data model but may find better support in code libraries and applications.)</p>\n<p>The third parameter shown for Case 1, is “queryType” which is another new SRU 2.0 parameter. I had noted earlier that an OpenSearch query string could be passed directly through to the Search Web Service and its associated CQL parser. It tuns out that this needs to be analyzed further. (And many thanks to Jonathan Rochkind for useful discussions on this.)</p>\n<p>I had naively assumed that an OpenSearch query string would either be packed as a CQL string or would be a simple text string which could be interpreted as CQL. The latter interpretation (text string) turns out to be true only for a single bare word or for a quoted string - both of which are recognized CQL query strings (i.e. a single search term which has a default index and relationship to that index). It fails, however, for the more general case of unquoted strings. See table below for these cases.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"50%\">\n<tr>\n<th width=\"50%\">\nQuery type\n</th>\n<pre><code>&lt;th width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;\nQuery string\n&lt;/th&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nA. bare word\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nthis\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nB. quoted string\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\n&amp;#8220;this is a query&amp;#8221;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nC. unquoted string\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nthis is a query\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>Case C would fail a CQL parser. So we need to signal to the Search Web Service that this is not a CQL string. And that’s where the “queryType” parameter comes in. If it’s set to “cql” then the query string is to be parsed as CQL, otherwise it must be handled in an alternate fashion. (As of now there is no value set for this parameter that I am aware of so I am using the terms “plain” and “cql” to differentiate.)</p>\n<p>How this should be handled by a CQL aware application is not immediately obvious. My first thought was to allow the application to silently quote such a string but that would change the semantics. It would be better to split the string into separate search clauses for each word and to join the search cluases by a default boolean operator, e.g. “<code>AND</code>“, so that case C in the table might be interpreted by the application as:</p>\n<p><blockqoute>``[<strong>Update - 2009.06.07:</strong> As pointed out by Todd Carpenter of NISO (see comments below) the phrase “<em>SRU by contrast is an initiative to update Z39.50 for the Web</em>” is inaccurate.

(Note that the key term here is “generic”, so neither <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\" target=\"_blank\">Solr</a>/<a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucene</a> nor <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/\" target=\"_blank\">XQuery</a> really qualify for that slot. Also, I am concentrating here on “classic” query languages rather than on semantic query languages such as <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">SPARQL</a>.)</p>\n<p>OpenSearch was created by Amazon’s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090610223844/http://a9.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A9.com</a> and is a cheap and cheerful means to interface to a search service by declaring a template URL and returning a structured XML format. It therefore allows for structured result sets while placing no constraints on the query string. As outlined in my earlier post <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/search-web-service\">Search Web Service</a>, there is support for search operation control parameters (pagination, encoding, etc.), but no inroads are made into the query string itself which is regarded as opaque.</p>\n<p>SRU by contrast is an initiative to update <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/\" target=\"_blank\">Z39.50</a> for the Web and is firmly focussed on structured queries and responses. Specifically a query can be expressed in the high-level query language <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/specs/cql.html\" target=\"_blank\">CQL</a> which is independent of any underlying implementation. Result records are returned using any declared W3C XML Schema format and are transported within a defined XML wrapper format for SRU. (Note that the <a href=\"https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/documents.php?wg_abbrev=search-ws\" target=\"_blank\">SRU 2.0 draft</a> provides support for arbitrary result formats based on media type.)</p>\n<p>One can summarize the respective OpenSearch and SRU functionalities as in this table:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"50%\">\n<tr>\n<th width=\"33%\" align=\"left\">\nStructure\n</th>\n<pre><code>&lt;th width=&quot;33%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nOpenSearch\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;33%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nSRU\n&lt;/th&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nquery\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nno\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nyes\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nresults\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nyes\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nyes\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\ncontrol\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nyes\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nyes\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\ndiagnostics\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nno\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\nyes\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>What I wanted to discuss here was the OpenSearch and SRU interfaces to a <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/search-web-service\">Search Web Service</a> such as outlined in my previous post. The <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/images/queryType.png\">diagram</a> at top of this post shows query forms for OpenSearch and SRU and associated result types. The Search Web Service is taken to be exposing an SRU interface. It might be simplest to walk through each of the cases.</p>\n<p>(Continues below.)</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p><em>Case 1: OpenSearch (Native Client)</em></p>\n<p>As noted, OpenSearch uses a URL template (declared in an OpenSearch description document) where recognized parameters are mapped to implementation-specific parameters. The bolded parameter “<strong>query</strong>” in the figure indicates an OpenSearch parameter “<strong>searchTerms</strong>” which has been mapped to the Search Web Service parameter “<strong>query</strong>“,</p>\n<p>As also noted, SRU 2.0 offers support for alternate result formats (other than SRU XML) by allowing a media type (aka mime type) to be passed in an “http:accept” parameter. There is, however, no OpenSearch parameter corresponding to a format selector, so this must be hard coded directly into the URL template with a value of “application/rss+xml” - the standard media type for an RSS feed which is the common result format for OpenSearch.</p>\n<p>(In the diagram I have noted in parentheses that RSS in its RSS 1.0 form is RDF. And that format is a strong candidate for semantic interoperability. An alternate format would be Atom, which could be similarly selected with a value of “application/atom+xml”, but it is difficult to see at this time what advantage Atom confers. It does not conform to the RDF data model but may find better support in code libraries and applications.)</p>\n<p>The third parameter shown for Case 1, is “queryType” which is another new SRU 2.0 parameter. I had noted earlier that an OpenSearch query string could be passed directly through to the Search Web Service and its associated CQL parser. It tuns out that this needs to be analyzed further. (And many thanks to Jonathan Rochkind for useful discussions on this.)</p>\n<p>I had naively assumed that an OpenSearch query string would either be packed as a CQL string or would be a simple text string which could be interpreted as CQL. The latter interpretation (text string) turns out to be true only for a single bare word or for a quoted string - both of which are recognized CQL query strings (i.e. a single search term which has a default index and relationship to that index). It fails, however, for the more general case of unquoted strings. See table below for these cases.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"50%\">\n<tr>\n<th width=\"50%\">\nQuery type\n</th>\n<pre><code>&lt;th width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;\nQuery string\n&lt;/th&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nA. bare word\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nthis\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nB. quoted string\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\n&amp;#8220;this is a query&amp;#8221;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nC. unquoted string\n</td>\n<pre><code>&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nthis is a query\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>Case C would fail a CQL parser. So we need to signal to the Search Web Service that this is not a CQL string. And that’s where the “queryType” parameter comes in. If it’s set to “cql” then the query string is to be parsed as CQL, otherwise it must be handled in an alternate fashion. (As of now there is no value set for this parameter that I am aware of so I am using the terms “plain” and “cql” to differentiate.)</p>\n<p>How this should be handled by a CQL aware application is not immediately obvious. My first thought was to allow the application to silently quote such a string but that would change the semantics. It would be better to split the string into separate search clauses for each word and to join the search cluases by a default boolean operator, e.g. “<code>AND</code>“, so that case C in the table might be interpreted by the application as:</p>\n<p><blockqoute>`` </blockquote></p>\n<p>Now, of course, we must not expect that a typical OpenSearch implementation would be aware of CQL (or any of the SRU technologies). Instead we can simply indicate in the URL template that the “queryType” is non-CQL, by hard coding “queryType=plain”. The actual URL template which is declared in the OpenSearch description would thus be something like the following (with whitespace added for clarity):</p>\n<pre>&lt;!-- 1. queryType=\"plain\" --&gt;\n&lt;Url type=\"application/rss+xml\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template=\"http://www.example/search?\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;query={<b>searchTerms</b>}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&queryType=plain\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&http:accept=application/rss+xml\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"\n/&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>This URL template uses one OpenSearch parameter(“searchTerms”) and that is mapped to the SRU parameter “query”. The SRU 2.0 parameters “queryType” and “http:accept” are wired in. This means that a Search Web Service would be aware of the query, would know that it was not CQL (so might invoke a handler), and would be know that a result set in RSS was required.</p>\n<p><em>Case 2: OpenSearch (CQL-Aware Client)</em></p>\n<p>The above case, works for a general OpenSearch client but now is problematic for a CQL-aware client. With the “queryType” set at “plain” there is no opportunity to indicate that a generic CQL string might be passed instead. We certainly wouldn’t want a non-CQL handler to operate on a valid CQL string. We need to vary the SRU 2.0 parameters and within the scope of OpenSearch this can only be done by recognizing the parameters as <a href=\"http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions\" target=\"_blank\">OpenSearch extensions</a>. Basically, an extension is nothing more than a separately namespaced element or attribute. Recommendation is that the XML namespace would resolve to a specification document detailing the intention and format of the extension.</p>\n<p>The URL template for a CQL-aware OpenSearch description could make use of the “queryType” and “http:accept” parameters as OpenSearch extensions (marked in bold italics in the figure) using a declaration like this:</p>\n<pre>&lt;!-- 2. queryType=\"cql\" --&gt;\n&lt;Url type=\"application/xml\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:sru=\"http://opensearch.example/sru-extension\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template=\"http://www.example/search?\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;query={<b>searchTerms</b>}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&queryType={<b>sru:queryType?</b>}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&http:accept={<b>sru:httpAccept?</b>}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"\n/&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>Note here that both parameters have been specified as being optional. Also the namespace here is pointed at a fictional OpenSearch extension document. (It doesn’t need to point to such a document - could be anything - but it is recommended that there be a specification.)</p>\n<p>I’m not aware of any such OpenSearch extension document for SRU currently existing but would be prepared to contribute to drafting such a document. It seems to me that it would be would be very useful for general OpenSearch/SRU compatibility and probably should detail all the SRU 2.0 parameters for “searchRetrieve”. In fact, that document could be the SRU spec itself, once that was established at a fixed URL. (Whether there should be a specific OpenSearch extension document depends on whether it would be useful to provide OpenSearch implementation details.)</p>\n<p><em>Case 3: SRU (Native Client)</em></p>\n<p>This is easy. We’re on home ground now. The query type is by default CQL, and the result format is SRU XML. The only thing that might be specified is “recordSchema” to require a schema for the result records, if there are alternate schemas supported by the Search Web Service. A default for the result records is anyway supplied.</p>\n<p><em>Case 4: SRU (Media-Typed Client)</em></p>\n<p>Again, we’re on familiar ground. For a media-savvy SRU interface we would need to use the SRU 2.0 parameter “http:accept”. This could be used to override the default SRU XML with an alternate format, e.g. RSS.</p>\n<p>And that’s about it for this review of aligning the OpenSearch and SRU interfaces. It seems that using URL templates and OpenSearch extensions as indicated should allow for an easy OpenSearch interface onto an SRU-based Search Web Service. At a minimum we just need a permanent URL for the SRU 2.0 spec (when finalized). Alternately a separate OpenSearch extension document could be drafted and registered. That would allow for details specific to OpenSearch to be provided, as well as bringing SRU closer into the OpenSearch realm. And such a document could be created now and updated with the URL for the SRU 2.0 spec as it progresses from draft to final.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Search Web Service","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/search-web-service/","published":"Sat, 30 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000","description":"(Click image to enlarge graphic.)

The SRU layer implements a heavyweight, robust service which provides a detailed listing of search indexes and index relations in the description document (‘SRU Explain’), is searchable using a standard query grammar - <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/specs/cql.html\" target=\"_blank\">CQL</a> (‘Contextual Query Language’), responds with result sets inside a standard XML wrapper and expressed as an XML record set (e.g. PAM) that is validatable using W3C XML Schema, and makes available a full roster of diagnostics.</p>\n<p>By contrast the OpenSearch layer provides a lightweight view onto the search web service in which a simple opaque query string is sent to the server and a simple XML result set returned (usually RSS or Atom). Again a description document is made available (‘OpenSearch Description’) but this is much more coarse grained than the SRU description - e.g. it does not specify query components such as indexes or relations.</p>\n<p>In practice, both views can be provided for by the same search web service. While OpenSearch does not specify any structured query it can make use of a CQL packaged query. That is, a single parameter value for the OpenSearch ‘query’ parameter can be unpacked by a CQL parser to yield a complex search query. The search query does not need to be splattered all over the URL querystring which is already using its parameter set to provide control information for the search (e.g. pagination, encoding and the like).</p>\n<p>And how would this relate to existing platform-hosted search services? Well, such services are usually bound to the host platform and are not intended to support remote applications. A search web service, on the other hand, would be ideally suited to offering direct support for running structured searches on platform-hosted content using off-platform apps.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":null,"title":"Structured Search Using PRISM Elements","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/structured-search-using-prism-elements/","published":"Sat, 30 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000","description":"We just registered in the SRU (Search and Retrieve by URL) search registry the following components: Context Sets PRISM Context Set version 2.0 PRISM Context Set version 2.1 Schemas PRISM Aggregator...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"thammond","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>We just registered in the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/\" target=\"_blank\">SRU</a> (Search and Retrieve by URL) search registry the following components:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><strong><em>Context Sets</em></strong></p></dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql/contextSets/prism-context-set-v2-0.html\" target=\"_blank\">PRISM Context Set version 2.0</a>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<dl>\n<dt><a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql/contextSets/prism-context-set-v2-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">PRISM Context Set version 2.1</a></ul></dt>\n<dt><strong><em>Schemas</em></strong></p></dt>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>PRISM Aggregator Message Record Schema Version 2.0\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PRISM Aggregator Message Record Schema Version 2.1</ul> </dl>\nThis means that an <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/\" target=\"_blank\">SRU</a> (Search and Retrieve by URL) search engine that supported one of the PRISM context sets registered above could accept <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/specs/cql.html\" target=\"_blank\">CQL</a> (Contextual Query Language) queries such as the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><tt>prism.doi = &ldquo;10.1038/nature05398&rdquo;</tt>\n<ul>\n<li><tt>prism.publicationName = &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; and prism.volume = &ldquo;444&rdquo; and prism.number = &ldquo;7119&rdquo; and prism.startingPage = &ldquo;E9&rdquo;</tt>\n<ul>\n<li><tt>dc.identifier = &ldquo;doi:10.1038/nature05398&rdquo;</tt>\n<ul>\n<li><tt>dc.creator = &ldquo;Jones-Smith&rdquo; and prism.publicationName = &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; and prism.publicationDate &gt; &ldquo;2006-01-01&rdquo;</tt>\n<ul>\n<li><tt>dc.title any &ldquo;fractal pollock&rdquo; and prism.publicationName = &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; sortBy prism.publicationDate/sort.descending</tt>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><tt>&ldquo;fractal anlysis&rdquo; and prism.publicationDate within &ldquo;2005-01-01 2008-12-31&rdquo; sortBy dc.creator/sort.ascending</tt></ol>\n(Note that the quotes are only needed above for the DOI strings which contain a “/” character.

For reasons of interoperability a base metadata format (‘Dublin Core’) is mandated for all OAI-PMH implementations. The expectation is that this base format would be augmented by community-specific vocabularies.</p>\n<p>Our natural inclination was to mirror the article descriptions which we already circulate in our RSS feeds and within our HTML pages (as META tags) and PDF files (as XMP packets). In these cases we have used open data models (e.g. RDF) with simple properties cherry-picked from the DC and PRISM namespaces. But OAI-PMH has a special ‘gotcha’ in this regard: any metadata format must allow for W3C XML Schema validation. That is, the properties need to be constrained by an XSD data model. Enter PRISM Aggregator Message (PAM).</p>\n<p>(Continues)</p>\n<p>For the longest time I must confess I did not ‘get’ what PAM was about. PRISM was clearly a metadata vocabulary and yet with PAM there was all this wrangling with content, which as an academic publisher we frankly had no interest in as we already had our own journal article DTD and for interop we were beginning to look at <a href=\"http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">NLM DTD</a>. And then it dawned on me (albeit slowly) that the PAM DTD is the equivalent to NLM DTD but for trade magazine publishing, where there might not be such a strong practice of XML. And since the release of PRISM 2.0 (February 2008) there was now also an W3C XML Schema defined for PAM. (Note that the latest revision of PRISM 2.1 is about to be published, although the changes there do not have any bearing on this implementation.)</p>\n<p>So, PAM defines PRISM elements to be used with XML content markup. Examining further reveals that within a PAM message there are one or more articles with metadata packaged into a head section, and content (if present) in a body section.</p>\n<img alt=\"pam-message.png\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/images/pam-message.png\" width=\"362\" height=\"71\" />\n<p>Section 4.3 in the PAM 2.0 specification lists the allowable head elements by logical grouping, 11 in all: <em>key elements</em>, <em>title</em>, <em>creative origin</em>, <em>publication</em>, <em>publication date</em>, <em>additional article ID</em>, <em>positional</em>, <em>topic</em>, <em>length</em>, <em>related content</em>, <em>rights &amp; usage</em>. Note that not all PRISM elements are supported; in fact only 43 of the 57 PRISM 2.0 elements are supported. Among the missing are ‘<tt>prism:endingPage</tt>‘. Also only 7 of the 15 DC elements are supported. Nevertheless we found that the bulk of the article descriptions could easily be accommodated within the PAM format. And because this is W3C XML Schema constrained there is an element ordering prescribed, and hence there is an interleaving of DC and PRISM elements.</p>\n<p>The Nature.com OAI-PMH service has two access points:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><em>User interface:</em></dt>\n<dd><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/oai\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nature.com/oai</a></dd>\n<dt><em>Service endpoint:</em></dt>\n<dd><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/oai/request\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nature.com/oai/request</a></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>So, to work an example, if we want to get the record for <strong>doi:10.1038/nature01234</strong> (which has an OAI-PMH identifier of <strong>oai:nature.com:10.1038/nature01234</strong>) we could use this call to get the description in PAM format:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/oai/request?verb=GetRecord&amp;#038;identifier=10.1038/nature01234&amp;#038;metadataPrefix=pam\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nature.com/oai/request?verb=GetRecord&#038;identifier=10.1038/nature01234&#038;metadataPrefix=pam</a></p>\n<p>(Note that as a convenience for the user we also allow a DOI to be used directly in place of the full OAI-PMH identifier as there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two within our repository.

The responses are both gratifying -there seems to be a general belief that Crossref has a roll to play here- and perplexing -most think the identifier needs to identify other “contributors” to the scholarly communications process- yet there seems to be a preference for the moniker “digital author identifier”. This latter preference is certainly a surprise to us as we had been focusing our efforts on identifying analog authors. The only “digital authors” I know of are <a href=\"http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/\">this one at at MIT</a> and possibly <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7979113.stm\">this one at Aberystwyth University.</a> 😉</span></p>\n<p><span >Anyway, There are some <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/e/bb174794-519c-02a7-8a00-9283013298d8/A-few-questions-about-author-identifiers-the\">additional reactions</a> to Martin’s poll on FriendFeed.</span></p>\n<p><span >Finally, I should have blogged about this earlier, but the March issue of <em>Science</em> included a summary of the initiatives and discussions surrounding the creation of an industry “author identifier” in an article titled “Are You Ready to Become a Number” (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.323.5922.1662\"><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.323.5922.1662\" target=\"_blank\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.323.5922.1662</a></a>).</span></p>\n<p><span >In pointing people at this, I feel like I must make a clarification to the article.

Basically, Trigg points out something that should be fairly obvious- a citation (i.e. “a link”) is not <em>always</em> a “vote” in favor of the thing being cited.<br /> In fact, there are all sorts of reasons that an author might want to cite something. They might be elaborating on the item cited, they might be critiquing the item cited, they might even be trying to refute the item cited (For an exhaustive and entertaining survey of the use and abuse of citations in the humanities, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grafton\">Anthony Grafton</a>‘s, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Footnote-Curious-History-Anthony-Grafton/dp/0571196012/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1237549279&#038;sr=1-2\">The Footnote: A Curious History</a>, is a rich source of examples)<br /> Unfortunately, the naive assumption that a citation is tantamount to a vote of confidence has become inshrined in everything from the way in which we measure scholarly reputation, to the way in which we <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/Research/ref/\">fund universities</a> and the way in which search engines rank their results. The distorting affect of this assumption is profound. If nothing else, it leads to a perverse situation in which people will often discuss books, articles, and blog postings that they disagree with without actually citing the relevant content, just so that they can avoid inadvertently conferring “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie\">wuffie</a>” on the item being discussed. This can’t be right.<br /> Having said that, there has been a half-hearted attempt to introduce a gross level of link typology with the introduction of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow\">“nofollow” link attribute</a>- an initiative started by Google in order to try to address the increasing problem of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing\">“Spamdexing”</a>. But this is a pretty ham-fisted form of link typing- particularly in the way it is implemented by the Wikipedia where Crossref DOI links to formally published scholarly literature have a “nofollow” attribute attached to them but, inexplicably, items with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMID\">PMID</a> are not so hobbled (view the HTML source of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion\">this page</a>, for example). Essentially, this means that, the Wikipedia is a black-hole of reputation. That is, it absorbs reputation (through links too the Wikipedia), but it doesn’t let reputation back out again. Hell, I feel dirty for even linking to it here ;-).<br /> Anyway, scholarly publishers should certainly read Shotton’s article because it is full of good, and practical ideas about what can can be done with today’s technology in order to help us move beyond the “digital incunabula” that the industry is currently churning out. The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090420020704/http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/pub/2008/plospaper/latest\">sample semantic article</a> that Shotton’s team created is inspirational and I particularly encourage people to look at <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090607084935/http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/pub/2008/plospaper/latest/machine/citationinfo.n3\">the source file for the ontology-enhanced bibliography</a> which reveals just how much more useful metadata can be associated with the humble citation.<br /> And now I wonder whether <a href=\"http://www.citeulike.org/\">CiteULike</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20061205061750/http://www.connotea.org/\">Connotea</a>, <a href=\"http://www.2collab.com/nonLoggedInHomePage;jsessionid=CC0849D76677D585AE1DC3B3139B32A1\">2Collab</a> or <a href=\"http://www.zotero.org/\">Zotero</a> will consider adding support for the CItation Typing Ontology into their respective services?<br /> * Disclosure:<br /> a) I am on the editorial board of <em>Learned Publishing</em><br /> b) Crossref has consulted with David Shotton on the subject of semantically enhancing journal articles</p></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Researcher Identification Primer","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/researcher-identification-primer/","published":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Discussions around “contributor Ids” (aka “Author ID, Researcher ID, etc.) seem to be becoming quite popular.

It may seem that I came out a little harsh on ORE and a little easy on POWDER. I just wanted to rationalize the justification for calling it that way. (By the way, the revised comparison table includes a qualification to those ratings.)</p>\n<p>My primary interest was from the perspective of a data provider rather than a data consumer. What does it take to get a resource description document (“resource map”, “description resource” or “sitemap”) ready for publication?</p>\n<p>(Continues)</p>\n<p>To look at POWDER first, it defines two sets of semantics: an “operational semantics” which is embodied in the simple XML that is intended as the primary publication vehicle, and a “formal semantics” embodied in the RDF/OWL document that would typically be generated by a POWDER processor.</p>\n<p>The operational semantics (XML) document requires minimal RDF understanding (and arguably none at all): it only requires that URI resources be organized into <strong><iriset></strong> groups by pattern matching, and that metadata be attached to those groups using <strong><descriptorset></strong> groups.</p>\n<p>URI patterns are specified using any of the following XML elements for inclusive patterns:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>&gt; **&lt;includeschemes&gt;**, **&lt;includehosts&gt;**, **&lt;includeexactpaths&gt;**, **&lt;includepathcontains&gt;**, **&lt;includepathstartswith&gt;**, **&lt;includepathendswith&gt;**, **&lt;includeports&gt;**, **&lt;includequerycontains&gt;**, **&lt;includeiripattern&gt;**, **&lt;includeregex&gt;**, **&lt;includeresources&gt;**\n</code></pre><p>and their exclusive counterparts</p>\n<p><code>**&lt;excludeschemes&gt;**, &amp;#8230;</code></p>\n<p>These are turned into corresponding regular expressions by a POWDER processor which then emits RDF/OWL classes using those expressions as property restrictions on set membership. <strong><em>But a publisher is not required to understand this transformation nor the formal semantics generated from the simple XML document that was authored.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Now, as to metadata. Resource group descriptors are either free text (tags) or properties from a published namespace. For example, the property <strong>name</strong> from a namespace <strong>ex:</strong> would be added in one of two ways, depending on whether it were a simple literal string (“value”, say) or a resource URI:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>http://example.org/value\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li><strong>&lt;ex:name rdf:resource=”<code>http://example.org/value</code>“/&gt;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While technically this is RDF/XML it hardly qualifies, I think, as requiring any great knowledge of RDF, more a knowledge of XML namespaces alone would be sufficient.</p>\n<p>And that’s about it – all that is required for publication of a POWDER “description resource” document. (The guidelines for discovery mechanisms of a POWDER document might also need to be consulted.)</p>\n<p>So, on that basis I would judge POWDER to be at most “medium” on the “Learn curve”. However, as soon as the mapping to the formal semantics (POWDER-S) using RDF/OWL is considered, then that learn curve rating would automatically swing to “high”.</p>\n<p>Now, ORE on the other hand is a straightforward RDF application. What does make ORE a bit of a challenge are the following two aspects:</p>\n<pre><code> 1. concept of named aggregation\n* abstract data model - no fixed bindings&lt;/ol&gt;\nWell, the first aspect is what ORE is all about &amp;ndash; its USP &amp;ndash; and what it gives us beyond the simpler POWDER approach of merely describing resource bundles. Still, it’s a concept that needs to be grokked. All too easy to take it for granted.\nIt is the second aspect that may make ORE appear to be &amp;#8220;difficult&amp;#8221;. It does not prescribe a single binding or set of bindings but provides an abstract data model. That means that a prospective user must endeavour to understand something of the model before deploying.\nBut enough of that. Because who really reads instruction manuals anyway? So to deploy there are user guides available for one standalone document format (RDF/XML), and two carrier document formats (Atom, RDFa). That means right there that the publisher must either embrace RDF/XML or learn how to weave it into an existing document markup. (By the way, it should be remarked that there is an excellent [primer][3] available - as there is also for POWDER - and user guides for each of the formats.)\nSo that I think warrants the &amp;#8220;high&amp;#8221; rating for ORE on the learn curve, and the corresponding &amp;#8220;low&amp;#8221; ease of use. But that is not to say that the two initiatives are in any competition and that one should be favoured over the other. They serve different purposes. Any yet they may also have compatibilities as the previous [mapping of ORE in POWDER][4] attempts to show. I’ll leave that task for other commentators.\n</code></pre>"},{"id":null,"title":"Resource Maps Encoded in POWDER","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/resource-maps-encoded-in-powder/","published":"Fri, 05 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Following right on from yesterday’s post on ORE and POWDER, I’ve attempted to map the worked examples in the ORE User Guide for RDF/XML (specifically Sect. 3) to POWDER to show that POWDER can be used to...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"thammond","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>Following right on from <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/describing-resource-sets-ore-vs-powder/\">yesterday’s post</a> on ORE and POWDER, I’ve attempted to map the worked examples in the <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/rdfxml\" target=\"_blank\">ORE User Guide for RDF/XML</a> (specifically <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/rdfxml#Examples\" target=\"_blank\">Sect. 3</a>) to POWDER to show that POWDER can be used to model ORE, see</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100901173559/http://nurture.nature.com/tony/demos/ore-ex/pwdr.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Resource Maps Encoded in POWDER</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(A full explanation for each example is given in the <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/rdfxml#Examples\" target=\"_blank\">RDF/XML Guide, Sect. 3</a> which should be consulted.)</p>\n<p>This could just all be sheer doolally or might possibly turn out to have a modicum of instructional value – I don’t know. (It would be real good to get some feedback here.) There are, however, a couple points to note in mapping ORE to POWDER:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The POWDER form is actually more long-winded because it splits the RDF triples into subject and predicate/object divisions, with the first listed within an <strong>iriset</strong> and the second within a <strong>descriptorset</strong>. The net effect, however, may be somewhat cleaner since POWDER uses a simple XML format rather than RDF/XML.\n<ul>\n<li>POWDER only supports simple object types (literals or resources) so the blank nodes in the RDF/XML examples for <strong>dcterms:creator</strong> cannot be mapped as such. I have chosen here to use either <strong>foaf:name</strong> or <strong>foaf:page</strong> value.\n<ul>\n<li>Likewise, and as far as I am aware, POWDER does not support datatyping but I could be wrong on this. I have thus dropped the datatypes on <strong>dcterms:created</strong> and <strong>dcterms:modified</strong>. </ol>\nThis is a fairly naïve mapping. POWDER’s real strength comes in defining groups of resources with its powerful pattern matching capabilities, whereas here I am using a named single resource in each <strong>iriset</strong> through the <strong>includeresource</strong> element. I think, though, this does show how the abstract ORE data model can be serialized in yet another format.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>"},{"id":null,"title":"Describing Resource Sets: ORE vs POWDER","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/describing-resource-sets-ore-vs-powder/","published":"Thu, 04 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000","description":"I’ve been reading up on POWDER recently (the W3C Protocol for Web Description Resources) which is currently in last call status (with comments due in tomorrow).

And there was I thinking that most everybody must have heard of them by now. 🙂 So anyway here’s something brief by way of explanation.</p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2008/ED-curie-20081023/\" target=\"_blank\">CURIE</a></em></strong> stands for <strong><em>Compact URI</em></strong> and does the signal job or rendering long and difficult to read URI strings into something more manageable. (URIs do have the particular gift of being “human transcribable” but in practice their length and the actual characters used in the URI strings tend to muddy things for the reader.) So given that the Web is built upon a bedrock of URIs, anything that then makes URIs easier to handle is going to be an important contributor to our overall ease of interaction with the Web.</p>\n<p>(Continues)</p>\n<p>Ten years back (in February 1998) when XML was first introduced it presented a flat naming system for document markup. For purposes of modularity and markup reuse the XML Namespaces specification released the following year allowed for element and attribute names to be replaced by <strong>expanded</strong> names in which the hitherto simple names would be replaced by name pairs consisting of a <strong>namespace</strong> name and a <strong>local</strong> name. The use of URIs for the namespace name thus opened the doors to assigning globally unique names for XML element/attribute names. As a practical point (both to keep the names short and to deal with URI characters), the notion of a qualified name (or QName) was introduced, whereby the local name would be qualified by a prefix which stood in for the namespace name.</p>\n<p>This was such a successful device that over time it was applied to URIs in general as a mechanism for abbreviation. Especially in RDF/XML schema elements were referenced by QName. And the practice has spilled over into non-XML syntaxes (e.g. the N3 and Turtle RDF grammars which use a “@prefix” directive). But there were problems since the device was grounded in XML the local names were constrained by allowable characters for XML elements and attributes (e.g. names cannot start with a digit character), as well as there being no specification for applying this same device to non-XML grammars.</p>\n<p>CURIE is an initiative to generalize this notion of qualified names for URIs beyond the immediate XML context for naming elements and attributes (which would also allow their use in attribute values), to a more general use in applications beyond XML. The development of CURIE is based upon work done in the definition of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2\" target=\"_blank\">XHTML2</a>, and upon work done by the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/HTML/\" target=\"_blank\">RDF-in-HTML Task Force</a>, a joint task force of the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/\" target=\"_blank\">Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/\" target=\"_blank\">XHTML 2 Working Group</a>. The Editor’s draft <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2008/ED-curie-20081023/\" target=\"_blank\">CURIE Syntax 1.0</a> is currently a W3C Candidate Recommendation which is receiving comments through Jan 15, 2009, at which time it is intended to put it forward as a W3C Proposed Recommendation. Meantime, though, the new W3C Recommendation <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/\" target=\"_blank\">RDFa Syntax in XHTML</a> (published Oct 14, 2008) has a normative section on CURIEs (see <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/#s_curies\" target=\"_blank\">Sect. 7</a>).</p>\n<p>So, what do CURIEs look like? Taking a simple RDFa example for DOI we might have a fragment such as:</p>\n<pre>&lt;div xmlns:doi=\"https://doi.org/\" xmlns:dcterms=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div <b>about=\"doi:10.1038/nature07184\"</b>&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span <b>property=\"dcterms:hasPart\"</b> <b>resource=\"[doi:10.1038/nature07184]\"</b>/&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>This would be processed by an RDFa processor to yield the RDF triple (in N3/Turtle):</p>\n<pre>&lt;doi:10.1038/nature07184&gt; dcterms:hasPart &lt;https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184&gt; .</pre>\n<p>This triple (or fact) says that the resource identified by DOI 10.1038/nature07184 has as a component part (cf. <a href=\"http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/\" target=\"_blank\">DCTERMS</a> vocabulary) the resource identified by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184</a>. (The abstract work identified by the DOI has as a component part the splash page identified by the proxy URL.)</p>\n<p>OK, so what’s going on? The “property” attribute takes a CURIE as value where the prefix “dcterms” is standing in for the XML namespace URI. The “about” and “resource” attributes both take a URI or CURIE as value, but because of any potential confusion a (so-called) “Safe CURIE” must be used which is a CURIE wrapped in brackets. The above example does not use brackets for the “about” attribute and therefore an RDFa processor would read this as being a full URI, i.e. &amp;lt’doi:10.1038/nature07184&gt;, whereas it does use brackets for the “resource” attribute and therefore this would be read as being a (Safe) CURIE, i.e. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184</a>.</p>\n<p>We can turn this around as follows:</p>\n<pre>&lt;div xmlns:doi=\"https://doi.org/\" xmlns:dcterms=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div <b>about=\"[doi:10.1038/nature07184]\"</b>&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span <b>property=\"dcterms:isPartOf\"</b> <b>resource=\"doi:10.1038/nature07184\"</b>/&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>This would be processed by an RDFa processor to yield the RDF triple (in N3/Turtle):</p>\n<pre>&lt;https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184&gt; dcterms:isPartOf &lt;doi:10.1038/nature07184&gt; .</pre>\n<p>This triple (or fact) says that the resource identified by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184</a> is a component part (cf. <a href=\"http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/\" target=\"_blank\">DCTERMS</a> vocabulary) of the resource identified by DOI 10.1038/nature07184. (The splash page identified by the proxy URL is a component part of the abstract work identified by the DOI.)</p>\n<p>So what do CURIEs give us? Nothing more than a generic means to be able to make human-friendly statements such as</p>\n<pre>&lt;doi:10.1038/nature07184&gt; dcterms:hasPart doi:10.1038/nature07184 .</pre>\n<p>instead of having to spell it out in full triples form using long-winded URIs:</p>\n<pre>&lt;doi:10.1038/nature07184&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;http://http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasPart&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07184&gt; .</pre>"},{"id":null,"title":"Ubiquity commands for Crossref services","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/ubiquity-commands-for-crossref-services/","published":"Wed, 03 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000","description":"So the other day Noel O’Boyle made me feel guilty when he pinged me and asked about the possibility using one of the Crossref APIs for creating a Ubiquity extension.

A response page without bibliographic information should never be presented to a user.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which would seem to be all fine and dandy. But if that user is a machine (or an agent acting for a user) they’ll likely be out of luck as the metadata in the bibliographic citation is generally targeted at human users.</p>\n<p>So here’s a quick and dirty implementation of what a machine readable page could look like using RDFa. (The demo uses Jeni Tennison’s wonderful [rdfQuery][2] plugin which I [blogged][3] about earlier.)</p>\n<p>Clicking the DOI link below will bring up in a sub-window a bibliographic citation which might be found in a typical DOI repsonse page. If you now click the “Read Me” link you should see an alert message which presents the bibliographic metadata as a complete RDF document (in a simple N3 – or Notation3 – format). This document is assembled on the fly by rdfQuery using the RDFa markup embedded in the page.</p>\n<!-- broken links not in wayback machine\n<a href=\"http://nurture.nature.com/tony/demos/rdfa.html\" onclick=\"w = open('http://nurture.nature.com/tony/demos/rdfa.html','myWin','width=600,height=400,top=150,left=150,scrollbars=1, resizable=1');w.focus();return false\"><b style=\"color:#006699\">https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05634</b></a> (Click for demo)\n-->\n<p>See the “View Source” link to list the actual XHTML markup and the RDFa properties which have been added. And note also that some of the properties are partially “hidden” to the human reader, e.g. a publication date is given in year form only whereas the machine record has the date in full, and some of the properties are fully “hidden”: print and electronic ISSNs, issue number, ending page, etc.</p>\n<p>(Continues below.)</p>\n<p>So, what’s new about this? There are already various means of adding metadata to pages using e.g. metadata tags (see [here][4] for an earlier post on this), or COinS objects, or even RDF/XML in comment sections. All of these have their various utilities but are still just early attempts at automation. What makes this new and compelling is that RDFa allows publishers to embed machine readable metadata that can be read as a complete machine description in RDF using pretty much off-the-shelf tools and that this markup is embedded unobtrusively into the content in the proper <strong><em>context</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Note that there are some similarities here between embedding an XMP packet (which includes metadata) into an arbitrary binary object, e.g. a PDF file, and embedding RDF into a section of a web page – or perhaps “<em>draping</em>” the RDF over the document markup would be a better term – so that the metadata travels along with the actual content.</p>\n<p>By the way, the RDFa can be processed to yield valid RDF (as is shown in the demo) and which can also be seen by running the web page through the [RDFa Distiller][5]. (You just need to cut and paste the link of the demo page given above into the Distiller form box.) This will produce RDF in various serializations (N3, XML, Triples) from the RDFa.</p>\n<p>So, is there really any longer any reason <em>not</em> to have machine readable metadata at the end of the DOI? Are we there yet?</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/5jchdy\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref DOI display guidelines</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/wiki/RdfPlugin\" target=\"_blank\">http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/wiki/RdfPlugin</a>\n[3]: /blog/rdfquery\n[4]: /blog/natures-metadata-for-web-pages\n[5]: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/</a></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"rdfQuery","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/rdfquery/","published":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Whaddya know?

The underscore is used in the handle RFCs for system types so that can be viewed as a sort of inline namespacing. Seems to be no obvious excuse for hyphens though.)</i></p>\n<p>Back to the example we can see that the first URL goes to a Crossref service which we can dispense with since this example is to be run client side. That leaves us with the two actual URL targets. But how to differentiate those for a user choice? That&rsquo;s where that other type &lsquo;CR-LR&rsquo; comes in which provides an XML fragment that relates label to type. There are obviously many ways to support resource labelling - this is just the method used by Crossref.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s parse out the XML fragment for labels and resources and save those in an

HTTP) as a courier - in effect, this is the “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile\" target=\"_blank\">last mile</a>” for Handle data. Typically an upstream (Handle) client provides services to the user. The most well known of these services is the URL redirect service which underpins the Crossref reference linking service. Another hosted service is the web form which displays data stored in the Handle records in a simple HTML table for user browsing. See panel a) in the figure above.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the OpenHandle proposal aims to move data in the Handle record in structured form (JSON or XML) over the Web for downstream processing - either in the user’s browser or on the desktop.

(DOI as a business and social compact for guaranteeing name persistence of Web resources has been an extraordinarily successful venture in the academic publishing world with more than 32m items registered and maintained over eight years of operation but that may not have required any specialized technology. More a consensus to adopt a single location service in the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DOI proxy</a>.)</p>\n<p>Multiple resolution, though. Now, that’s something else. Seems like it should be able to offer a lot of general funkiness and yet it has not been much used up to now. And I have to wonder why.</p>\n<p>(Continues below.)</p>\n<p>I guess we should start out with some definitions: the DOI Handbook, the (draft) ISO standard, and Crossref:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090301014307/http://www.doi.org/hb.html\" target=\"_blank\">DOI Handbook</a> - From <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080704170549/http://www.doi.org/handbook_2000/resolution.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sect. 3.3 Multiple resolution</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Multiple resolution allows one entity to be resolved to multiple other entities; it can be used to embody e.g a parent-children relationship, or any other relationship. … A DOI name can be resolved to an arbitrary number of different points on the Internet: multiple URLs, other DOI names, and other data types.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://doi.org/ISO_Standard/sc9n475.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ISO CD 26324</a> - I’ve blogged <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/iso/cd-26324-doi/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> before about the ISO standardization of DOI which is now <a href=\"http://doi.org/ISO_Standard/sc9n475.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">available</a> as a Committee Draft. Multiple resolution is specifically mentioned in Sects. 3.2 and 6.2 and discussed in Sect. 6.1. From Sect. 3 “Terms and definitions” we have this definition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Multiple resolution is the simultaneous return as output of several pieces of current information related to the object, in defined data structures.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then Section 6 “Resolution of DOI name” goes on to say this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>_“DOI resolution records may include one or more URLs, where the object may be located, and other</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>information provided about the entity to which a DOI name has been assigned, optionally including but not restricted to: names, identifiers, descriptions, types, classifications, locations, times, measurements, and relationships to other entities.”_</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a> - In the help page <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/creating-and-managing-dois/multiple-resolution/\">Multiple Resolution Intro</a> there is this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“As of May 2008 the Crossref main system will support assigning more than one URL to a single DOI, a concept known as multiple resolution (MR). “</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The intro goes on to talk about the two pilot forms of multiple resolution service that have been trialled: a) interim page, and b) menu pop-up. The pop-up service is no longer supported. Only the interim page is currently offered as a production service. The help page <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/education/content-registration/creating-and-managing-dois/multiple-resolution/\">Interim Page multiple resolution overview</a> leads off thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Crossref’s MR service provides an interim page solution which presents a list of link choices to the end user. Each choice represents a location at which the item may be obtained and are commonly services that are co-hosting the content under agreement with the content’s Copyright holder.”</em></ul></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, there it is. That’s DOI multiple resolution. The real important thing to note is that the official DOI position (IDF, ISO) is invitingly open while both the Crossref implementation and the description of multiple resolution itself is unduly restrictive. Multiple resolution as described by Crossref is essentially the deposition of additional URLs (pointing to copies of the same resource) for alternate routing (for geographical reasons, co-hosting arrangements, etc.) with a service presentation of alternate locations for user selection.</p>\n<p>Multiple resolution proper (as per the DOI Handbook and ISO draft) is the deposition of arbitrary data values and return of same with <em>no particular services implied</em>. Use cases for multiple resolution include the addition of URLs for referencing different (but related) network objects, e.g. a metadata record, or other resources such as supplementary information, datasets, etc. Deposit of arbitrary data types is not yet catered for by Crossref. There could, I would suggest, at least be some rudimentary provision for depositing vanilla type/value pairs (subject to policy constraints). (There is currently some work under way in defining handle data types but this need not be any showstopper to depositing new data types as any type management system will likely need to evolve over time.)</p>\n<p>An obvious use case for multiple resolution (to me, anyway) would be the registration of a second URL which would point not onto a copy of the resource but onto a public metadata record. (I have earlier posted here about <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/exposing-public-data\">architectures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/exposing-public-data-options/\">options</a> for exposing public data.)</p>\n<p>With more than one data value in a resolution record, the process of resolving such a record is potentially complicated. As the ISO CD says in Sect. 62f:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Resolution requests should be capable of returning all associated values of current information, individual values, or all values of one data type.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The DOI Handbook itself recognizes the problems that multiple resolution may present.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“If the DOI name can point to many different possible “resolutions”, how is the choice made between different options? At its simplest, the user may be provided with a list from which to make a manual choice. However, this is not a scalable solution for an increasingly complex and automated environment. The DOI name will increasingly depend on automation of “service requests”, through which users (and, more importantly, users’ application software) can be passed seamlessly from a DOI name to the specific service that they require.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, services like <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/openhandle/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenHandle</a> will make it much easier to programmatically access data stored in the handle record associated with a DOI name. (I have blogged previously about the OpenHandle <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/openhandle-google-code-project/\">project</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/openhandle-languages-support/\">languages support</a>.) Note that presentation of data values to a human user may be a non-issue for mediated services.</p>\n<p>And talking of computer languages it may be amusing to ruminate briefly on their own built-in support for multiple return values. Perhaps unsurprisingly, of the dominant languages Java has no such support as this <a href=\"http://www.osnews.com/story/20076/Multiple_Return_Values_in_Java\" target=\"_blank\">recent post</a> addresses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Today was one of those days when I wished Java would support multiple return values… but Java allows you to return only one value either an object or a primitive type.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By contrast, languages such as Common Lisp do have support for multiple return values. See <a href=\"http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2833\" target=\"_blank\">this post</a> for some gory details and insights. Interesting also to reflect that as in the world of computing languages where there is a decided tilt towards a mainstream family of languages based on (or derived from) C, there may be dominant protocols at large on the Internet but no single “winner takes all”.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":null,"title":"mod_prism (Updated)","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/mod_prism-updated/","published":"Thu, 21 Aug 2008 00:00:00 +0000","description":"I’ve just put up for comment a revised mod_prism (0.3) of the existing mod_prism RSS 1.0 module.

This places certain constraints on service discovery and persistence. Autodiscovery links can be placed into Web pages, but there is no opportunity to ‘embed’ the services into the DOI itself, and hence these cannot be considered native DOI services. Without a published API (and hence some degree of commitment from the publisher) the service access points (and possibly the services, too) are fragile.<br /> Option #2 would require Crossref to develop a service which would either a) deliver some public data on behalf of the publisher, or b) route requests through to a bespoke publisher service. Both options would require development at Crossref and an upload mechanism for the publisher to pass along data or service address. Both options would be offered as a new member service and would thus likely be subject to membership policy arrangements. One should consider that there would be some restrictions on service operation. One possible restriction might be that this would be a one-time service registration at Crossref and that any additional services would need to be added at the publisher end.<br /> Option #3 uses the existing <a href=\"http://www.handle.net/\">Handle System</a> infrastructure and provides a public read service. There are two possibilities: a) add a record (or records) to the DOI handle, or b) add records to a DOI ‘buddy’ handle under publisher control. Both require further explanation:<br /> Option #3a would require Crossref consent. Unless these records (handle values) were registered by Crossref there would be concerns over interoperability. That and security concerns would almost certainly require that Crossref writes the record. But this would then need to be developed as per Option #2 above. And if a mechanism were put in place it could be restrictive in practice, e.g. not allowing additional records to be inserted (as already noted in Option #2).<br /> Option #3b requires no prior Crossref consent. It is an option available to publishers who run a handle server. This can best be viewed as deploying a platform (a DOI ‘buddy’ handle) for hosting service access points with an intention to upload into the DOI handle (effectively Option #3a) as common public services are developed. In short, a public service incubator. Meantime the platform provides for an independent deployment and multiple services can be added as required. An uplink from a so-called DOI ‘buddy’ handle to the DOI handle would be maintained, and also as Crossref allows a down link from the DOI handle to the DOI ‘buddy’ handle (a ‘see also’ type link) could be established thus pairing off these two handles. (Of course, additional values whether held in the DOI resolution record or especially in an associated DOI ‘buddy’ record would be subject to common typing constraints for semantic interoperability.)<br /> My personal feeling is that public data is best exposed via a public resolution record with no strings attached. That is the surest way to guarantee both data persistence and accessibility.\n</p></p>"},{"id":null,"title":"The Thing About DOI","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-thing-about-doi/","published":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000","description":"With Library of Congress sometime back (Feb. ’08) announcing LCCN Permalinks and NLM also (Mar. ’08) introducing simplified web links with its PubMed identifier one might be forgiven for wondering what is the...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"thammond","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>With Library of Congress sometime back (Feb. ’08) <a href=\"http://catalogablog.blogspot.com/2008/02/lccn-permalink.html\" target=\"_blank\">announcing</a> <a href=\"http://lccn.loc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">LCCN Permalinks</a> and NLM also (Mar. ’08) introducing <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/ma08/ma08_simplified_web_links.html\" target=\"_blank\">simplified web links</a> with its PubMed identifier one might be forgiven for wondering what is the essential difference between a DOI name and these (and other) seemingly like-minded identifiers from a purely web point of view.

What is different about this and, say a <a href=\"http://purl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PURL</a>, which offers a similar redirect service? What’s the big deal?</p>\n<p>(Continues below.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, the thing about DOI is that it is built upon a directory service - the <a href=\"http://www.handle.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Handle System</a> - and can be accessed either through native directory calls or more likely through standard web interfaces. From a web point of view we are usually interested in the latter. Differently from a simple lookup and/or redirect service which has a fixed entry point on the Web, the DOI can be serviced at <em>any</em> DOI service access point on the Internet. There are potentially multiple entry points which can be hosted by different organizations with separate IP addresses and/or DNS names.</p>\n<pre><code> For example, the [DOI proxy][8] (described [here][9]) is just _one instance_ of such a service. Others could equally exist. And, in fact, they do. The following handle web services will also take the DOI and do the business:\n* &lt;http://hdl.handle.net/10.1000/1&gt;\n* &lt;http://hdl.nature.com/10.1000/1&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\nWith handle we have in essence a redirect to a redirect. Or in the case of a web service, a redirect (from HTTP to HDL) to a redirect (from HDL to HDL) to a redirect (from HDL to HTTP). That is, switch down from the web interface to the native handle layer, route the call from this local handle sever (via the global handle server) to the DOI handle server, fetch the URL stored with the DOI and switch back to the Web at that location.\nBut there’s more. The standard URL redirect is just _one_ example of a DOI service. But multiple services can also be provided for the DOI. Currently the DOI travels light and is bound to the minimum of useful data, essentially just the URL for a splash page in the case of many Crossref DOIs. But it could also carry pointers to structured information or to relationships with other objects.\nAs yet, the DOI is a fledgling in terms of realizing its true potential as a seasoned actor that can play out many roles - assume many guises. A queen bee, in effect, with a hive of worker bees servicing it. It is not joined at the hip with any particular web service as might be commonly understood with the current simple redirect service. It offers much more.\nIt is, however, true that both for reasons of link persistency and in order to maintain link ranking with search crawlers that a preferred web entry point is via the [DOI proxy][8]. It just doesn’t have to be that way - that’s all. Hard linking is something we are beginning to unlearn and instead we are taking our first steps towards embracing service-mediated links such as OpenURL and DOI can both offer.\n</code></pre>"},{"id":null,"title":"Handle System Workshop","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/handle-system-workshop/","published":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000","description":"I was invited to speak at the Handle System Workshop which was run back to back with an IDF Open Meeting earlier this week in Brussels and hosted at the Office for Official Publications of the European Union....","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"thammond","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<img alt=\"charlemagne.jpg\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/images/charlemagne.jpg\" width=\"275\" height=\"134\" />\n<p>I was invited to speak at the <a href=\"http://www.handle.net/workshop_08/\" target=\"_blank\">Handle System Workshop</a> which was run back to back with an <a href=\"http://www.doi.org/doi_presentations/members_meeting_2008/\" target=\"_blank\">IDF Open Meeting</a> earlier this week in Brussels and hosted at the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.

The namespace issue listed above still holds.\n<ul>\n<li>The “<code>citation_</code>” terms are not anchored in any published namespace which does make this term set problematic in application reuse. It would be useful to be able to reference a namespace (e.g. “<code>rel=&quot;schema.gs&quot; href=&quot;...&quot;</code>“) for these terms and to cite them as e.g. “<code>gs.citation_title</code>“. </ul>\nThe HTML metadata sets from an example <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06925\" target=\"_blank\">landing page</a> are presented below.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you view the page source you should see something like the text below.

The publisher has to sign up with PMC for specifying the header graphic and the links. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080916065531/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmcdoc/pubsetup.doc\" target=\"_blank\">https://web.archive.org/web/20080916065531/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmcdoc/pubsetup.doc (word doc)</a> say “The static base (<a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.biomedcentral.com/</a>) of the URLs for this link comes from the HTML template. PMC then dynamically completes the URL by adding an issn/vol/page. ” and then says that any item in the XML (such as the DOI) can be used.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both of the approaches outlined above require extra work and will be difficult for smaller publishers. In addition, the links will be fragile by not being based on DOIs. Publishers can specify that DOIs can be used but it isn’t easy. We’d like to leverage the resources that publishers have already put into the DOI system but automatically making the DOIs active links - it would be very easy.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"OpenHandle: Languages Support","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/openhandle-languages-support/","published":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Following up the earlier post on OpenHandle, there are now a number of language examples which have been contributed to the project.

And, as PRISM is one of the major vocabularies being used by publishers, I would urge you all to go take a look at it and to consider upgrading your applications to using it.</p>\n<p><strong>One caveat.</strong> There’s a new element <code>&lt;tt&gt;prism:doi&lt;/tt&gt;</code> (PRISM Namespace, 4.2.13) which sits alongside another new element <code>&lt;tt&gt;prism:url&lt;/tt&gt;</code> (PRISM Namespace, 4.2.55). Unfortunately the <code>&lt;tt&gt;prism:doi&lt;/tt&gt;</code> element is shown to take DOI proxy URL as its value - and not the DOI string itself, e.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model #1<br>\n<code>&lt;prism:doi rdf:resource=”http://dx.doi.org/10.1030/03054”/&gt;</code></li>\n<li>Model #2<br>\n<code>&lt;prism:doi&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1030/03054&lt;/prism:doi&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This seems to me to just plain wrong. The DOI in itself is not a URL (or URI) - although can, and should, be represented in URI form when used in Web contexts (i.e. pretty much most of the time). As a literal it should be used in its native form as specified in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223621/http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/14689/z39-84-2005_r2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> ANSI/NISO Z39.84 - 2005 Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier</a>. This would only satisfy Model #2 above.</p>\n<p>To satisfy Model #1 above a URI form for DOI would be required. And this is <strong>not</strong> the service URI denoted by the proxy. It would either have to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model #1 - Registered URI Form<br>\n<code>&lt;prism:doi rdf:resource=”info:doi/10.1030/03054”/&gt;</code>\n* Model #1 - Unregistered URI Form<br>\n<code>&lt;prism:doi rdf:resource=”doi:10.1030/03054”/&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any comments? Some guidelines from Crossref would be useful - although maybe further discussion is required.

The plugin supports both a long citation format and a short (op. cit.) format.</p>\n<h2 id=\"warnings-caveats-and-weasel-words\">Warnings, Caveats and Weasel Words</h2>\n<p>Please note the following about this plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We are releasing this as a test. It is running on R&amp;D equipment in a non-production environment and so it may disappear without warning or perform erratically. If it isn’t working for some reason, come back later and try again. If it seems to be broken for a prolonged period of time, then please report the problem to us via sourceforge.</li>\n<li>There is currently a 20 item limit on the number of hits returned per query. This might seem arbitrary and stingy, but please remember- we are not trying to create a fully blown search engine- we’re just trying to create a citation lookup service. Of course, if, after looking at how the service is used, it looks like we need to up this limit, we will.</li>\n<li>If you look in the plugin options (or at the code), you will see that the system includes an API key. At the moment we have no restrictions on use of this service, but have included this in case we need to protect the system from abuse.</li>\n<li>The bulk of the functionality we have developed is actually at the back-end. This plugin is just a lightweight interface to that back-end. You can examine the guts of the plugin in order to easily figure out how to create similar functionality for your favorite blog platform, wiki, etc. If you do create something, please let us know. We’d love to see what people are building.</li>\n<li>We are continuing to experiment with the metadata search function in order to increase its accuracy and flexibility. Again, this might result in seemingly inconsistent behavior. Did we mention that this is a test?</li>\n<li>Please note that this API is not meant for bulk harvesting of Crossref metadata. If you need such facilities, then please look at our web site for information about our metadata services.</li>\n<li>The data currently behind the plugin is *just* a December 2007 snapshot of our our complete journal article metadata. We have not added books or proceedings yet. We will do so soon and we will start updating the metadata weekly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We welcome your ideas for tools that we can provide to help researchers.

One solution <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/i-want-my-xmp/\">proposed earlier</a> is to embed a minimal packet which could then reference a more complete description in a standalone packet. (And in turn this standalone packet could reference additional sources of metadata.)</dd>\n<dt><em>Images</em></dt>\n<dd>While considerably simpler to write into web-delivery image formats (e.g. JPEG, GIF, PNG), it is the case that metadata pertinent to the image only is likely to be embedded. Also, of interest is the work from which the image is derived which is most likely to be presented externally to the image as a standalone document. (And in turn this standalone packet could reference additional sources of metadata.)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>(Continues)</p>\n<p>Thus the two cases - PDF documents and images - are not dissimilar.

The XMP is used to embed a minimal description into the media file with references to a fuller work description and to additional sources which are presented as generic RDF/XML. That is, the metadata descriptions use generic RDF/XML exclusively and only resort to the idiomatic RDF/XML employed by XMP for embedding descriptions into binary structures.</p>\n<img alt=\"Hybrid - D.jpg\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/images/Hybrid%20-%20D.jpg\" width=\"303\" height=\"191\" />\n<p><em>Fig. 4 - XMP “bootstrap” only - metadata descriptions proper are generic RDF/XML.</em></p>\n<p>If I were to choose I might opt for the scenario presented in Fig. 3, but the scenarios in both Figs. 2 and 4 leave room for thought.

Nor, likewise is XMP likely to be provided (or even tolerated) down the metadata trail. And the metadata is not going to be fully encapsulated within a media file.

What’s the point? They are almost guaranteed to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\" target=\"_blank\">fail to resolve</a> after a few years. In citing them, you are hardly helping to preserve the scholarly record. You might as well just record the metadata associated with the content.</p>\n<p>So why don’t we simply allow individuals to assign DOIs to their content?</p>\n<p>As Chuck Koscher says, “Crossref DOIs are only as persistent as Crossref staff.” Crossref depends on its ability to chase down and berate member publishers when they fail to update their DOI records. Its hard enough doing this with publishers, so just imagine what it would be like trying to chase down individuals. In short, it just wouldn’t scale.</p>\n<p>But what if we provided a different service for more informal content? Recently we have been in talking with Gunther Eysenbach, the creator of the very cool <a href=\"http://www.webcitation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WebCite</a> service about whether Crossref could/should operate a citation caching service for ephemera.</p>\n<p>As I said, I think WebCite is wonderful, but I do see a few problems with it in its current incarnation.</p>\n<p>The first is that, the way it works now, it seems to effectively leech usage statistics away from the source of the content. If I have a blog entry that gets cited frequently, I certainly don’t want all the links (and their associated <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_juice\" target=\"_blank\">Google-juice</a>) redirected away from my blog. As long as my blog is working, I want traffic coming to my copy of the content, not some cached copy of the content (gee- the same problem publishers face, no?). I would also, ideally, like that traffic to continue to come to to my blog if I move hosting providers, platforms (WordPress, Moveable Type) , blog conglomerates (Gawker, Weblogs, Inc.), etc.</p>\n<p>The second issue I have with WebCite is simpler. I don’t really fancy having to actually recreate and run a web-caching infrastructure when there is already a <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">formidable one</a> in existence.</p>\n<p>So what if we ran a service for individuals that worked like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>For a fee, you can assign DOIs to your ephemeral, CC-licensed content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you assign a DOI to an item of content (or update an existing DOI), we will immediately archive said content with the Internet Archive (who, incidentally, <a href=\"http://www.archive-it.org/\" target=\"_blank\">charges for this service</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will direct those DOIs to your web site as long as you are both:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paying the fee</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updating your URLs to point to the correct content</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you fail in either “a” or “b”, we will then redirect said DOIs to the cached version of the content on the Internet Archive (after having warned you repeatedly via automated e-mail).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Note, as an aside, that we could in theory provide a similar dark-archive service for publishers with non free content using something like JStore as the archive)</p>\n<p>This approach would help to ensure that a blogger’s version of content was always linked to as long it was available. It would also preserve the “persistence” of Crossref DOIs by making sure that we could always resolve the DOI even if we were not able to get the owner of said DOI to update it.</p>\n<p>So back to the NLM guidelines… On the one hand, I’m delighted to see that the NLM has issued guidelines on citing blogs. It seems glaringly obvious that informal (and ephemeral) content such as blogs and wikis are increasingly becoming vital parts of the scholarly record. On the other hand, it also seems to me that recommending that somebody “cite” with a broken pointer (i.e. a URL) to content verges on tokenism. This isn’t the NLM’s fault- there just isn’t a reliable mechanism for citing informal content in a manner that ensures you can then retrieve and look at said content in the future.</p>\n<p>And this is no longer a problem confined to the Scholarly/Professional publishing space. As Jon Udell has occasionally <a href=\"http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/01/29/the-persistent-blogosphere/\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out,</a> citation is increasingly an important currency for *any* professional writer on the web. It seems to me that a system for reliably citing blogs and wikis would benefit many communities. I could easily see commercial hosted Blog services (Blogger, WordPress) offering a “Cached-DOI” feature as a premium service to their clients.</p>\n<p>So what do you think? What am I missing? is this something we should be looking at?</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"OpenDocument Adds RDF","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/opendocument-adds-rdf/","published":"Sun, 14 Oct 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Bruce D’Arcus left a comment here in which he linked to post of his: “OpenDocument’s New Metadata System“.

Not everybody reads comments so I’m repeating it here. His post is worth reading on two counts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He talks about the new metadata functionality for OpenDocument 1.2 which uses <em>generic</em> RDF. As he says:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>&gt; _&amp;#8220;Unlike Microsoft’s custom schema support, we provide this through the standard model of RDF. What this means is that implementors can provide a generic metadata API in their applications, based on an open standard, most likely just using off-the-shelf code libraries.&amp;#8221;_\nThis is great. It means that description is left up to the user rather than being restricted by any vendor limitation. (Ideally we would like to see the same for XMP. But Adobe is unlikely to budge because of the legacy code base and documents. It’s a wonder that Adobe still wants XMP to breathe.)\n* He cites a wonderful passage from Rob Weir of IBM (something which I had been considering to blog but too late now) about the changing shape of documents. Can only say, go read [Bruce’s post][2] and then [Rob’s post][3]. But anyway a spoiler here:\n&gt; _&amp;#8220;The concept of a document as being a single storage of data that lives in a single place, entire, self-contained and complete is nearing an end. A document is a stream, a thread in space and time, connected to other documents, containing other documents, contained in other documents, in multiple layers of meaning and in multiple dimensions.&amp;#8221;_&lt;/ol&gt;\nI think the ODF initiative is fantastic and wish that Adobe could follow suit. However, I do still hold out something for XMP. After all, nobody else AFAICT is doing anything remotely similar for multimedia. Where’s the W3C and co. when you really need them? (Oh yeah, [faffing][4] about the new [Semantic Web logo][5]. 😉\n</code></pre>"},{"id":null,"title":"I Want My XMP","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/i-want-my-xmp/","published":"Sat, 13 Oct 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Now, assuming XMP is a good idea - and I think on balance it is (as blogged earlier), why are we not seeing any metadata published in scholarly media files?

A little focus and ingenuity should do the trick. I do, however, think 2) is just a crazy straitjacket that Adobe is forcing us all to wear but if we have to live with that then so be it. Better in Bedlam than without. (RSS 1.0 wasn’t so much better but allowed us to do some useful things. And that came from the RDF community itself.) We could argue this till the cows come home but I don’t see any chance of any change any time soon.</p>\n<p>(Continues)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, putting the RDF issue aside for the moment (as if RDF didn’t have problems of its own - XML, URI, etc.) let’s just look at the options for writing the stuff. (Btw, I’m not referencing any tools or toolkits. This is just in the round.) There are various means of publishing metadata in XMP:</p>\n<pre><code> **Sidecar**\n: XMP can be produced as standalone files - see [XMP Specification, (Sept. ’05)][3], p. 36. (These are called &amp;#8220;sidecar&amp;#8221; files if the file has the same name as the main document and is in the same directory.) The only things needed to produce these files are a text editor and a good grasp of the XMP serialization. A template will do for that. The main problem with a standalone file is that it does not travel with the media file and so risks being left behind.\nWorth a note here. Not standalone as such but the [Mars][4] format (the draft XML formalization for PDF) discloses its metadata in an independent XMP file &amp;#8220;metadata.xml&amp;#8221; under the &amp;#8220;META-INF/&amp;#8221; directory. For distribution the whole directory structure is packaged up as a zip file and so the XMP is embedded in a &amp;#8220;.mars&amp;#8221; file, but accessed directly from the zip file or from the unpackaged directory the XMP can be manipulated just like any other XML document.\n**Embedded**\n: This is the normal means of distributing XMP - embedded within the media file. Some graphics formats are essentially linear (JPEG, PNG, GIF) and it is relatively straightforward to add in an XMP packet. Other formats (PDF, TIFF) have internal cross-referencing and are more difficult to deal with.\n**Embedded + Sidecar**\n: One possible method for dealing with the difficulty of writing XMP is to note that some media (especially PDFs) already have embedded XMP packets. As noted earlier, much if not all of the metadata in these XMP packets will be workflow-related and thus dispensible for final-form products where authority work-related metadata is desired. These packets may, or may not, be writeable and thus include additional padding whitespace. Even for read-only packets there is much (if not all) that can be discarded and also sometimes unnecesary bulk (e.g. default namespace declarations which are never used). _The bottom line is that any legacy XMP packet may typically be 2-3K in size and, just as in transplanting a cell nucleus, the XMP packet innards can be deftly substituted with a minimal XMP packet content, say 1K in size, which would be guaranteed to fit with suitable padding._ A packet that size would be sufficient to provide at minimum for a DOI and for a reference to additional metadata, e.g. a more complete standalone XMP packet. The two forms can coexist.\nThe third way option here allows embedding a minimal XMP packet into &amp;#8220;difficult&amp;#8221; packaging structures while pointing out to a fully-formed XMP packet. The &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; packaging structures may both include a fully-formed XMP packet while also possibly referencing extended metadata sources as per my previous post [here][4].\n</code></pre>"},{"id":null,"title":"Metadata - For the Record","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-for-the-record/","published":"Sat, 13 Oct 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Interesting post from Gunar Penikis of Adobe entitled “Permanent Metadata” Oct. ’04). 1.

The web service model is designed to provide the authentication and permissions needed. The link between the two provided by unique IDs. In fact, unique IDs are already created by Adobe applications and stored in the XMP - that is what the XMP Media Management properties are all about.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An intriguing idea. Of course, Gunar’s (and Adobe’s) preoccupations with metadata revolve mainly around document workflow whereas, at least as things stand currently, scholarly publisher concerns are mainly with the dissemination of media in final form. Hence some differences in thinking:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><strong>Subject</strong></dt>\n<dd>As just noted Adobe are more interested in workflow than in work. Scholarly articles are rich in descriptive metadata about the work itself and have a well-developed ctation model. Academic interest is in the intellectual content rather than the vehicle used to carry and preserve that content - the file format.</dd>\n<dt><strong>Unique IDs</strong></dt>\n<dd><dl>\n<dt>Workflow IDs are UUIDs which identify specific instances and expressions, but do not identify the abstract work. UUIDs provide a unique identifier but there is no central registry for such identifiers, hence they cannot be “looked up”. Crossref publishers should be concerned to associate closely the DOI for the underlying work with a given media file. That’s the identifier that this community is actively promoting.</p></dt>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dt><strong>Read/Write</strong></dt>\n<dd>Because of the focus on workflow, the XMP specification recommends that XMP packets be “writeable”, that is that they be marked as “writeable” and that they include padding whitespace which can accommodate updates without changing packet size. Publishers distributing final form documents are more likely to want to distribute “read-only” metadata which is authoritative and which describes the work, rather than the document format and workflow. Of course, this should not preclude additional sources of metadata which may be added “by reference” rather than “by value”. That is, a pointer to a web page (or service) may be sufficient to relate additional publisher terms and user annotations instead of embedding them directly in the file for various reasons: a) file integrity, b) limiting growth of file size, c) term authority, d) dynamic production (in forward time), and e) multiple sources.</dl></dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Update Aug 2022: the blog post mentioned below was previously at blogs.adobe.com/gunar/2007/10/permanent_metadata.html but is no longer live.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"},{"id":null,"title":"DataNet","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/datanet/","published":"Fri, 12 Oct 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Last week, my colleague Ian Mulvany posted on Nascent an entry about NSF’s recent call for proposals on DataNet (aka “A Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network”).

(In XML it doesn’t make a blind bit of difference as XML namespaces are just a scoping mechanism.) So to have a property URI as</p>\n<pre>http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.htmlAuthor\n</pre>\n<p>does the job but looks pretty rough and more importantly precludes (at least, complicates) the possibility of dereferencing the URI to return a page with human or machine readable semantics.

(You can judge for yourselves whether the metadata disclosed here is sufficient to describe the document.) Here, the metadata is taken from the information dictionary and from the document metadata stream (XMP packet).</p>\n<p>The metadata is expressed in RDF/N3. That may not be a surprise for the XMP packet which is serialized in RDF/XML, as it’s just a hop, skip and a jump to render it as RDF/N3 with properties taken from schema whose namespaces are identified by URI. What may be more unusual is to see the document information dictionary metadata (the “normal” metadata in a PDF) rendered as RDF/N3 since the information dictionary is not nodelled on RDF, not expressed in XML, and not namespaced. Here, in addition to the trusty HTTP URI scheme, I’ve made use of two particular URI schemes: “<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-goodwin-iso-urn-02.html\" target=\"_blank\">iso:</a>” URN namespaces, and “<a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.txt\" target=\"_blank\">data:</a>” URIs.</p>\n<p>(Continues.)</p>\n<p>As far as I am aware, there is no formal identifier for entries in the document information dictionary as specified by the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html\" target=\"_blank\">PDF Reference</a> from Adobe Systems, so it may be appropriate to use the HTTP URI for the Adobe homepage for the PDF Reference manual, from which specific editions are available.</p>\n<p>For the PDF/X keys which are specified in the ISO standard ISO 15930-1 2001, I have used an ISO URN. (I don’t expect this to be correct in all details but it should give some idea of how it might be used. It may be that the URI should express the term itself, rather than the document from which the term was defined.) And finally, for the one additional user-supplied key here I have made use of a “data:” URI with no body (i.e. I’m speechless). One could have provided some text within the body of the “data:” URI if one wanted to differentiate between alternate user keys or to otherwise annotate these keys.</p>\n<p>Note that the prefixes used in the information dictionary and in the metadata stream are unrelated, as are the mappings of property elements to schemas.</p>\n<p>Well, that’s all really just for fun but it may show two things: 1) how a general description might be described with RDF and how general properties can be mapped to URIs (with possibly limited machine utility), and 2) how an ISO URN might be used.</p>\n<pre># document infodict (object 58: 476983):\n@prefix: pdfx: &lt;urn:iso:std:iso-iec:15930:-1:2001&gt; .\n@prefix: pdf: &lt;http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html&gt; .\n@prefix: _usr: &lt;data:,&gt; .\n&lt;> _usr:Apag_PDFX_Checkup \"1.3\";\npdf:Author \"Scott B.

Following on from an industry open day event last year:</p>\n<pre><code> * [IDEAlliance XMP Open Day][5], New York, March ’06&lt;/ul&gt;\nthere have been two metadata summits earlier this year co-sponsored by Adobe Systems and IDEAlliance:\n* [Metadata Directions in Advertising and Branding][6], San Francisco, January ’07\n* [Content Metadata Summit 1.1][7] New York, March ’07&lt;/ul&gt;\nPromising bestirrings. (And also with the recent public airing of the PRISM 2.0 draft with its support for XMP which was reviewed at the PRISM WG F2F last week for publication as a standard.) But generally the state of XMP-Ville at this time is rather sleepy. There’s not much by way of news on the [XMP Open][8] website. At least promise, if no promises.\nBack to the articles. The really interesting thing of note (to me at any rate) in Roszkiewicz’s review of the last summit is the almost total absence of any mention of the Web. It is as if XMP users (both consumers and providers) would be content to play within the walled garden of the CS3 product portfolio. I don’t get that. The Web changes everything.\nAlthough XMP maps its native data model to RDF (and RDF is an inherently open technology allowing arbitrary schemas to be mixed at will), XMP betrays its application roots by seeming to want to impose some kind of veto on the schemas to be used. Or rather, how they are to be used. It also seems to be all fussed up by centralized notions such as a cross-mapping schema registry. (As if that were part of its remit.)\nAs Roszkiewicz notes:\n&gt; _&amp;#8220;The consortia [IDEAlliance and the stakeholders] will have ownership responsibility for name space registry, cross-map definition and support, standards group outreach and coordination, compliance certification and logo and the “XMP Open” brand.&amp;#8221;_\nAnd elsewhere:\n&gt; _&amp;#8220;So while the standard for XMP might be defined, the data that will be fed into files is not, for want of an IDEAlliance-like standards management body to filter and rationalize the many [schema] into a few.&amp;#8221;_\nAnd then more worryingly, this:\n&gt; _&amp;#8220;That schema should be managed by a government agency such as the Library of Congress which could manage the dictionaries and schema, certify them, register the namespace and provide a centralized location to distribute them.&amp;#8221;_\nWell, I don’t see what this matters to the core technology of XMP which is just a specification for the sneaking in of an XML document into arbitrary media files. And the use of RDF/XML would seem to be a further indication that XMP is to be independent of the schema used. The use of both RDF plus XML technologies should allow XMP to present itself as a framework or &amp;#8220;platform&amp;#8221; for metadata exchange and to get out of the way of what is actually carried by the XMP packets. App neutrality, if you will.\nAgain the notion of Web as just an alternate channel is apparent in the third of the articles where Roszkiewicz talks about the Device Central tool which allows a user of a CS3 product to &amp;#8220;Save for Web or Devices&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;. This article talks about the clumsy handling of metadata in such device saves, whereby the packet may be abbreviated - and metadata terms dropped - when printing to small footprint devices. Not a feature to be retained for too long, I would hope.\nSo, where are we currently with XMP? According to Roszkiewicz:\n&gt; _&amp;#8220;As the developer of a suite of applications that relies on XMP as the vehicle for managing metadata, Adobe has too much invested in its development to allow any substantive changes by outsiders. So “open” primarily will mean open to suggestions, with an official channel in place to process them.&amp;#8221;_\nAnd as to that channel?\n&gt; _&amp;#8220;As the principal conduit to Adobe for changes to XMP, IDEAlliance will act as a gateway and support organization to the user community - a role for which it is well-suited. &amp;#8230; As a sponsor-supported, not-for-profit organization, IDEAlliance can serve as a credible buffer for Adobe to the user community and synchronize and standardize third-party development efforts.&amp;#8221;_\nAnd goes on:\n&gt; _&amp;#8220;The principal unanswered questions at this point are: Will the stakeholders represent all of the key industries; will Adobe provide timely support for considering user input and updating the XMP Toolkit; and can Adobe, IDEAlliance and IDEAlliance workgroups manage all of the responsibilities that will fall upon them when the deal is struck. The hand-over doesn’t seem to have taken place yet, and we are still examining the scope and feasibility of the proposal.&amp;#8221;_\nIt seems to me that Adobe is the party girl, IDEAlliance is the special guest, and Crossref publishers are the neighbourly gatecrashers who want to play with the toys. And not perhaps too nicely neither. I just hope that the toys aren’t taken away from us. They’re too much fun.\nIronic really that we’re on the outside of this since scholarly publishers have a very clearcut grasp of what to do with metadata and a ready application in terms of citation linking. XMP is worth it.\n</code></pre>"},{"id":null,"title":"The Name’s The Thing","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-names-the-thing/","published":"Thu, 20 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"I’m always curious about names and where they come from and what they mean.

And now I’m also wondering if this original name still reflects Adobe’s thinking on the purpose of XMP that it be primarily an authoring utility rather than a workflow utility. That is, is Adobe’s XMP more geared to individual authors of Adobe’s Creative Suite products entering in metadata by hand as part of the authoring act, rather than as a batch entry process within an automated publishing workflow? The emphasis that Adobe put on <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/custompanel.html\" target=\"_blank\">Custom File Info panels</a> for their CS products would seem to foster the view that Adobe see XMP as an interactive authoring device for adding metadata.

Use Cases</a> where he notes that Elsevier are looking to upgrade their markup of DOI in PDF to use XMP, I’m really hoping that Elsevier may have something to bring to the party and share with us. A consensus rendering of DOI within XMP is going to be of benefit to all.)</p>\n<p>(Continues.)</p>\n<p>Within an XMP packet our first idea might be to include the DOI using the Dublin Core (DC) schema element <tt>dc:identifier</tt> in minimalist fashion:</p>\n<pre>@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; dc:identifier \"10.1038/nrg2158\" .\n</pre>\n<p>This simply says that the current document (denoted by the empty URI “<tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>“) has a string property <tt>&ldquo;10.1038/nrg2158&rdquo;</tt> which is of type <tt>identifier</tt> from the <tt>dc</tt> (or Dublin Core) schema which is identified by the URI <tt><a href=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" target=\"_blank\">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</a></tt>.</p>\n<p>Now, since this is just a DOI and the wider public cannot be expected to know about DOIs, it would surely be better to present the DOI in URI form (<tt>doi:</tt>) as</p>\n<pre>@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; dc:identifier \"doi:10.1038/nrg2158\" .\n</pre>\n<p>or, using a registered URI form (<tt>info:</tt>) as</p>\n<pre>@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; dc:identifier \"info:doi/10.1038/nrg2158\" .\n</pre>\n<p>Aside: This shows up a limitation of XMP where the DC schema property value for <tt>dc:identifier</tt> is fixed as type <strong><tt>Text</tt></strong>. The natural way to express the above in RDF/N3 would be as:</p>\n<pre>@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; dc:identifier &lt;info:doi/10.1038/nrg2158&gt; .\n</pre>\n<p>which says that the value is a URI (type <strong><tt>URI</tt></strong> in XMP terms), not a string (type <strong><tt>Text</tt></strong> in XMP terms). We either have to flout the XMP specification or else live with this restriction. We’ll opt for the latter for now.</p>\n<p>But, the XMP Spec deprecates the use of <tt>dc:identifier</tt> since the context is not specific. (Note that that’s what was just discussed above. The limitation is built into XMP which builds on RDF but does not fully endorse the RDF world view.) Instead the XMP Spec recommends using <tt>xmp:Identifier</tt> since the context can be set using a qualified property as:</p>\n<pre>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n@prefix xmp: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/&gt; .\n@prefix xmpidq: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/Identifier/qual/1.0/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; xmp:Identifier [\na rdf:Bag;\nrdf:_1 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"DOI\";\nrdf:value \"10.1038/nrg2158\" ] ] .\n</pre>\n<p>This says the string <tt>&ldquo;10.1038/nrg2158&rdquo;</tt> belongs to the scheme <tt>&ldquo;DOI&rdquo;</tt>.</p>\n<p>Here we have used the scheme “DOI” and, as noted above, for wider recognition it would be better to employ one of the URI forms, e.g.</p>\n<pre>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n@prefix xmp: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/&gt; .\n@prefix xmpidq: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/Identifier/qual/1.0/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; xmp:Identifier [\na rdf:Bag;\nrdf:_1 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"doi:10.1038/nrg2158\" ] ] .\n</pre>\n<p>This says the string <tt>&ldquo;doi:10.1038/nrg2158&rdquo;</tt>belongs to the scheme <tt>&ldquo;URI&rdquo;</tt>.</p>\n<p>But this is the unregistered URI form (<tt>doi:</tt>), so should we be using instead the registered form (<tt>info:</tt>)? Well, turns out that this construct for <tt>xmp:Identifier</tt> is an <tt>rdf:Bag</tt> so we can include more than one term. How about using this construct then:</p>\n<pre>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n@prefix xmp: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/&gt; .\n@prefix xmpidq: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/Identifier/qual/1.0/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; xmp:Identifier [\na rdf:Bag;\nrdf:_1 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"info:doi/10.1038/nrg2158\" ];\nrdf:_2 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"doi:10.1038/nrg2158\" ] ] .\n</pre>\n<p>Now we’ve got both forms, which is fair enough since these are equivalent. In RDF terms we can make the statement that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>doi:10.1038/nrg2158 owl:sameAs info:doi10.1038/nrg2158 .</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which asserts that the two URIs are equivalent and that they reference the same resource.</p>\n<p>So, what if we want to include a native DOI without the URI garb? We can easily do that:</p>\n<pre>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n@prefix xmp: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/&gt; .\n@prefix xmpidq: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/Identifier/qual/1.0/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; xmp:Identifier [\na rdf:Bag;\nrdf:_1 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"info:doi/10.1038/nrg2158\" ];\nrdf:_2 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"doi:10.1038/nrg2158\" ];\nrdf:_3 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"DOI\";\nrdf:value \"10.1038/nrg2158\" ] ] .\n</pre>\n<p>OK, that takes care of the XMP direction to use <tt>xmp:Identifier</tt>, but, while deprecated by XMP, we note that back in the real world folks will be looking at the DC elements which is the schema with the greatest purchase. So, why not also add in a <tt>dc:identifier</tt> element such as would be used typically for DOI in citations. How about this:</p>\n<pre>@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .\n@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n@prefix xmp: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/&gt; .\n@prefix xmpidq: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/Identifier/qual/1.0/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; xmp:Identifier [\na rdf:Bag;\nrdf:_1 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"info:doi/10.1038/nrg2158\" ];\nrdf:_2 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"doi:10.1038/nrg2158\" ];\nrdf:_3 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"DOI\";\nrdf:value \"10.1038/nrg2158\" ] ];\ndc:identifier \"doi:10.1038/nrg2158\" .\n</pre>\n<p>Right, so we’ve taken care of the identfiers. But maybe there’s something missing? There’s no link to the DOI proxy. For widest applicability we should not assume prior knowledge of the DOI system. Perhaps we could include this link using the property <tt>dc:relation</tt>? Seems feasible though would really like to get some feedback on this. Any ideas?</p>\n<p>So here, then, is a fairly full and complete expression of DOI within the XMP packet.</p>\n<pre>@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .\n@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n@prefix xmp: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/&gt; .\n@prefix xmpidq: &lt;http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/Identifier/qual/1.0/&gt; .\n&lt;&gt; xmp:Identifier [\na rdf:Bag;\nrdf:_1 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"info:doi/10.1038/nrg2158\" ];\nrdf:_2 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"URI\";\nrdf:value \"doi:10.1038/nrg2158\" ];\nrdf:_3 [\nxmpidq:Scheme \"DOI\";\nrdf:value \"10.1038/nrg2158\" ] ];\ndc:identifier \"doi:10.1038/nrg2158\";\ndc:relation \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrg2158\" .\n</pre>\n<p>Ta-da!</p>\n<p>(Of course, this is all premised on having freedom in writing out the XMP packet. If one is dependent on commercial applications to write out the packet then things may be different. Actually, they will be very different. They may not even be workable.)</p>\n<p>Feedback would be very welcome.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"The Second Wave","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-second-wave/","published":"Tue, 11 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"You might have been wondering why I’ve been banging on about XMP here.

Why the emphasis on one vendor technology on a blog focussed on an industry linking solution? Well, this post is an attempt to answer that.</p>\n<p>Four years ago we at <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nature Publishing Group</a>, along with a select few early adopters, started up our RSS news feeds. We chose to use <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\">RSS 1.0</a> as the platform of choice which allowed us to embed a rich metadata term set using multiple schemas - especially Dublin Core and PRISM. We evangelized this much at the time and published documents on <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/07/23/rssone.html\" target=\"_blank\">XML.com</a> (Jul. ’03) and in <a href=\"http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december04/hammond/12hammond.html\" target=\"_blank\">D-Lib Magazine</a> (Dec. ’04) as well as speaking about this at various meetings and blogging about it. Since that time many more publishers have come on board and now provide RSS routinely, many of them choosing to enrich their feeds with metadata.</p>\n<p>Well, RSS can be seen in hindsight as being the <strong><em>First Wave</em></strong> of projecting a web presence beyond the content platform using standard markup formats. With this embedded metadata a publisher can expand their web footprint and allow users to link back to their content server.</p>\n<p>Now, XMP with its potential for embedding metadata in rich media can be seen as a <strong><em>Second Wave</em></strong>. Media assets distributed over the network can now carry along their own metadata and identity which can be leveraged by third-party applications to provide interesting new functionalities and link-back capability. Again a projection of web presence.</p>\n<p>(Continues.)</p>\n<p>XMP has much in common with RSS 1.0. They are both profiles of RDF/XML. They are both flawed in certain respects because of self-imposed limitations. But they both build on a robust and open data model for the web (RDF) and are reasonably open, at least they are extensible. One (RSS 1.0) was defined in an open process by committee, the other is an open (i.e published) specification provided by a vendor.</p>\n<p>From our point of view both specifications are sufficiently advanced to be immediately useful. I’m not sure how one could interact with the further development of either specification. RSS 1.0 is essentially frozen with Atom being posed as a successor technology, although Atom does not conform to the RDF model. (The upshot is that an RSS 1.0 feed can be consumed completely by an RDF-aware application, while an Atom feed would need to be pre-processed before any RDF “goodness” could be gleaned from it.) By contrast, XMP is a vendor-defined technology and alive, if not perhaps kicking. I am unaware of any process to formally contribute to the XMP development apart from shouting from the terraces. None the less, both technologies are usable as is.</p>\n<p>It is curious that no consistent packaging (and delivery) of metadata has yet been achieved with HTML, the original web interface. The HTML <tt><title></tt> and <tt><meta></tt> elements are employed by publishers with various degrees of consistency. There are also RDF islands that can be embedded within HTML comments (as used e.g. by <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CC licenses</a>). And then there are <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090927174724/http://ocoins.info/\" target=\"_blank\">COinS</a> objects. But it’s all a bit of a mish-mash to date. Certainly, I don’t recall seeing any guidelines from Crossref as to how machine readable metadata (even markup for the DOI itself) may be embedded within HTML pages, rather than on HTML pages for human readers.</p>\n<p>This lack of uniform metadata deployment for HTML pages could be something to do with context. With RSS and XMP we are dealing with remote objects, whereas with HTML we are generally accessing this directly on the content server and so have a semantic context. It could be though that metadata delivery from HTML pages will finally be more uniformly available with the further development of standards such as <a href=\"http://microformats.org/\" target=\"_blank\">microformats</a> and especially <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/RDFa/syntax/\" target=\"_blank\">RDFa</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec\" target=\"_blank\">GRDDL</a>, etc. It is also interesting to note that an XMP packet could just as easily be embedded within the HTML page, and if this technology were to be adopted more widely for embedding in other media assets then why not consider the same technology for ordinary web pages?</p>\n<p>I can’t help feeling though that XMP has a lot of promise and is very timely. There are only three real obstacles: creating XMP packets, writing them and reading them. To my mind, once one has a good grasp of XMP then creating the packets can be done with common tools. The same, more or less, for reading the packets. I have shown earlier that this is readily achievable. The only major block is writing the packets into media files although there is support for create/write (if patchy) by open source libraries, as well as there being support (perhaps limited) from products for create/write. But, anyway, it’s certainly do-able.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/w5m0mpcehihzreszntczkc9d/","published":"Mon, 10 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"What on earth can this string mean: ‘W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d’?

UUID</em></p>\n<p>Note also that many Adobe apps do not use the URN syntax for ‘<tt>uuid:</tt>‘. The XMP Spec also has this to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>_“There is no formal standard for URIs that are based on an abstract UUID. The following proposal may be relevant:</p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4122/\" target=\"_blank\">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4122/</a>;</i></p>\n<p>(see: 3 XMP Storage Model / Serializing XMP / rdf:Description elements / rdf:about attribute)”</i></blockquote></p>\n<p>I guess the XMP Spec (Sept. ’05) had just been bedded down more or less when the URN namespace for ‘<tt>uuid:</tt>‘ was published as <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 4122</a> in July ’05.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>4. RDF/XML serialization</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biggie.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>XMP schemas specify fixed property value types in RDF/XML, i.e. they specify a fixed profile of RDF/XML instead of generic RDF/XML. This has been commented on recently by <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2007Sep/0007.html\" target=\"_blank\">myself</a> on the <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/\" target=\"_blank\">semantic-web</a> list, and also <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2007Sep/0008.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> by Bruce D’Arcus speaking about OpenDocument, and <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2007Sep/0027.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> by Mike Linksvayer speaking for CC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This profiling of RDF/XML leads to real problems. For example, Adobe have defined a Dublin Core (DC) schema which lists the property value types that DC values can assume in an XMP serialization. Meantime, the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070910031332/http://www.prismstandard.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PRISM 2.0</a> draft spec defines an incompatible mapping of DC terms to XMP property values. Since both schemas would make use of the same DC namespace (though PRISM haven’t actually specified a DC namespace for use with XMP but do use elsewhere the regular DC namespace) this isn’t going to work. I did supply some feedback on this to the PRISM WG but have heard nothing back from them. So, PRISM XMP looks uncertain at this time. Which, for us, must be a shame.</p>\n</blockquote>"},{"id":null,"title":"connecting things: bioGUID, iSpiders and DOI","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/connecting-things-bioguid-ispiders-and-doi/","published":"Fri, 07 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"David Shorthouse and Rod Page have developed some great tools for linking references by tying together a number of services and using the Crossref OpenURL interface amongst other things.

There are two key sections which deal with metadata in PDF/X: “2.3 Identification and conformance”, and “2.20 Document identification and metadata”.</span></p>\n<p><span >Section 2.3 states that a conforming PDF/X file has the key “<tt>/GTS_PDFXVersion</tt>” in the document information dictionary, and (depending on version) may or may not have the key “<tt>/GTS_PDFXConformance</tt>“.</span></p>\n<p><span >Section 2.20 then talks about inclusion of a document ID within the document trailer to ensure correct identification of the file. It then goes on specifically to say:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Additionally, the use of the PDF version 1.4 Metadata key is allowed. Note that although information placed using this mechanism may be beneficial to production processes, any reader that is not PDF version 1.4 compliant may ignore this information.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >That is, PDF/X requires the use of a document information dictionary with the key “<tt>/GTS_PDFXVersion</tt>” (and as version demands also the key “<tt>/GTS_PDFXConformance</tt>“) to signal conformance. It is lukewarm, though with regard to the inclusion of XMP metadata (as would be indicated by the “<tt>/Metadata</tt>” key in the document catalog).</span></p>\n<p><span ><b><i>PDF/A</i></b></span></p>\n<p><span >The main reference I’m using here is the “ISO DIS 19005-1:2005” draft cited below [PDF/A, 1].</span></p>\n<p><span >Completely differently from PDF/X, PDF/A puts all its attention on the XMP metadata, while at the same time acknowledging that the document information dictionary may be used. Note 1 in Section 6.7.3 notes that:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><i>“Since a document information dictionary is allowed within a conforming file, it is possible for a single file to be both PDF/A-1 and PDF/X [12, 13] conformant.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >The non-normative Annex B also has this to say:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><i>“Use of non-XMP metadata at the file level is strongly discouraged as there is no assurance that such metadata can be preserved in accordance with this specification. In cases where non-XMP metadata is present, the preference is to convert it to XMP, embed it in the file, and describe the conversion in the xmpMM:History property.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >It’s not fully clear here whether “file level” is intended to be the same as “document level”. But note that this anyway is from a non-normative section and does not reflect the actual normative wording used in the standard (Section 6.7.3) which allows the use of the document information dictionary.</span></p>\n<p><span >The key section for our purposes in the standard is “6.7 Metadata”.</span></p>\n<p><span >Section “6.7.2 Properties” says:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><i>“The document catalog dictionary of a conforming file shall contain the Metadata key. The metadata stream that forms the value of that key shall conform to XMP Specification. All metadata properties pertaining to a file that are embedded in that file, except for document information dictionary entries that have no analogue in predefined XMP schemas as defined in 6.7.3, shall be in the form of one or more XMP packets as defined by XMP Specification, 3. Metadata properties shall be specified in predefined XMP schemas or in one or more extension schemas that comply with XMP requirements. Metadata object stream dictionaries shall not contain the Filter key.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >This is quite something. Not only is PDF/A fully supportive of XMP (even if Adobe sometimes appear to be less than enthusiastic) it actually requires it. Further it says that the XMP packets shall be human readable (well, apart from the small matter of XML, that is :).</span></p>\n<p><span >Section “6.7.3 Document information dictionary” then goes on to say:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><i>“A document information dictionary may appear within a conforming file. If it does appear, then all of its entries that have analogous properties in predefined XMP schemas, as defined by Table 1, shall also be embedded in the file in XMP form with equivalent values. Any document information dictionary entry not listed in Table 1 shall not be embedded using a predefined XMP schema property.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >This says that the primary source of metadata will be the XMP packet and that, as far as possible, metadata properties in the document information dictionary will be mapped directly to the XMP packet as specified and will not cause any conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span >I’m not quite sure how to read the last sentence. Does that mean that is one were to use an “<tt>/Identifier</tt>” key in the document information dictionary then one couldn’t map it as “<tt>dc:identifier</tt>“, say, in the XMP. I think that would be OK. My read is that it precludes the use of a predefined term within the information dictionary, so one couldn’t have something like “<tt>dc:identifier</tt>” in the information dictionary.</span></p>\n<p><span >Note also that the one quirky mapping in Table 1 which arises from the need to sync the information dictionary entries with the XMP properties is this:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><i>“If the dc:creator property is present in XMP metadata then it shall be represented by an ordered Text array of length one whose single entry shall consist of one or more names. The value of dc:creator and the document information dictionary Author entry shall be equivalent.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >This means that:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><i>“The document information dictionary entry:<br /> </i></span></p>\n<pre><span >/Author (Peter, Paul, and Mary)</span></pre>\n<p><span > </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >is equivalent to the XMP property:</span></p>\n<pre><span >&lt;dc:creator&gt;\n</blockquote>\n<p>&lt;rdf:Seq&gt;\n&lt;rdf.:li&gt;Peter, Paul, and Mary&lt;/rdf:li&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;\n&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n</span></pre></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span >“</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >Weird, or what? Well, of course, I see the rationale, but …</span></p>\n<p><span >The remaining sections of interest here are “6.7.6 File identifiers” which says that:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><i>“A conforming file should have one or more metadata properties to characterize, categorize, and otherwise identify the file. This part of ISO 19005 does not mandate any specific identification scheme. Identifiers may be externally based, such as an International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), or internally based, such as a Globally Unique Identifier/Universally Unique Identifier (GUID/UUID) or another designation assigned during workflow operations.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >Hmm, not that DOI is a file identifier necessarily. And certainly not in the Crossref usage where is denotes a work rather than a manifestation.</span></p>\n<p><span >Section “6.7.8 Extension schemas” talks about the need to rigorously declare any extension (undefined) schema with the following PDF/A extension schema description schema properties:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span >pdfaSchema:schema</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span >pdfaSchema:namespaceURI</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span >pdfaSchema:prefix</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span >pdfaSchema:property</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span >pdfaSchema:valueType</span><span >I think this means that were PRISM terms to be used the extension schema terms would need to be defined.</span></p>\n<p><span >And finally, the section “6.7.11 Version and conformance level identification” says that:</span></p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span ><i>“The PDF/A version and conformance level of a file shall be specified using the PDF/A Identification extension schema defined in this clause.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span >This uses the PDF/A identification schema properties:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >pdfaid:part</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span >pdfaid:amd</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span >pdfaid:conformance</span><span ><b><i>Summary</i></b></span></p>\n<p><span >What does this all mean? Main lessons are to be learned from PDF/A which endorses (well, actually mandates) the use of XMP. Moreover, it requires that the document information dictionary and the XMP packet be in sync. Why it signals conformance through the XMP packet rather than through the information dictionary (as does PDF/X) is a mystery. Or at least not specify a means to also signal conformance through the information dictionary. The latter is readily get-at-able. A very crude hack to extract a PDF information dictionary can be as simple as</span></p></p>\n<pre><span >% strings &lt;filename.pdf&gt; | grep \"/Producer\"\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></span></pre></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;span &gt;or some other likely key. That will usually pull a line containing the full dictionary. The XMP packet is much harder to extract and then you’re still left with XML to parse.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span &gt;My gut feeling is that both mechanisms should be required (and sync’ed). And it’s hard not to see the DOI being required in both sections. Leads to considerations on which schemas/terms to use and how to render the DOI. I am biased and would prefer to see it rendered in URI form, i.e. in an inclusive rather than an exclusive representation. DOI is special - but not that special. Other identifiers are also useful.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span &gt;As per my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/metadata-in-pdf-1.-strategies/&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, I could imagine that both DC and PRISM terms could be added to an XMP packet. I’m not sure whether there is any real interest at this time to follow the PDF/A specification or rather to be informed by it. There seems to be a lot of overhead and I’m still looking to meet up with some examples (either in the wild or fabricated) to see what it might look like in practice.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span &gt;Interested as always in others’ views.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span &gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;References&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span &gt;So, note that these are ISO documents and as such are available for purchase from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070614003151/http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/ISOstore/store.html&quot;&gt;ISO Store&lt;/a&gt;.

And that comes with its own baggage, i.e. this is a Windows only plugin and is targeted at Acrobat Reader 8. On a wider purview the application merely bridges an identifier embedded in the media file and the handle record filed against that identifier and delivers some relevant functionality. The data (or metadata) declared in the PDF and in the associated handle if rich enough and structured openly can also be used by other applications. I think this is a key point worth bearing in mind, that the demo besides showing off new functionalities is also demonstrating how data (or metadata) can be embedded at the respective endpoints (PDF, handle).</p>\n<p>Some initial observations follow below.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Install problems</em></strong></p>\n<p>As noted in my previous post I had to haul out the old HP laptop and engage in a dialog with our IT folks to get both Acrobat Reader 8 and the plugin installed as I did not have admin privileges on my own machine. Wasn’t pretty but they were kind.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Useability</em></strong></p>\n<p>I don’t know what’s happening here but from our network it seems as if the first attempts to contact the handle server are timing out and the handle client in the plugin is failing over to an alternate route (HTTP?). So, the plugin doesn’t work as expected since the user has to wait an untenably long time (somewhere between 60s and 90s). Of course, if a certain network access policy is required that would need to be specified and implemented by institutions for their users.</p>\n<p>I used both Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers and ran into occasional Acrobat plugin crashes which would lock up the browser. Due to the severe network access problems noted above I wasn’t able to rigorously test this further apart from to note that it was “buggy”.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Functionality</em></strong></p>\n<p>I tested most of the demo cases, but was hampered by the useability restrictions noted above. I didn’t see the “Related Links” or get the “Collections” to work but did see all the other cases and tried the buttons provided.</p>\n<p>One thing of note is that the Crossref metadata record was spoofed and returned from a stored data file rather than an active query to Crossref. A real query would have been been interesting to guage the impact of network latency, although the lookup point is made by hardwiring a response.</p>\n<p><strong><em>PDF Metadata</em></strong></p>\n<p>OK, so the document DOI is embedded in the PDF both in the document information dictionary and in the (document) metadata stream within an XMP packet. This is great although I do have some specific comments about how the DOI is actually disclosed. See my <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-in-pdf-2.-use-cases\">Metadata in PDF: 2. Use Cases</a> post for details.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Handle Data</em></strong></p>\n<p>Handle types are generally a matter for the handle administrators to oversee, although the unregulated use of new types is not going to help foster interoperability between handle applications. In passing I note that the handles used in this demo</p>\n<pre>10.5555/pdftest-collection\n10.5555/pdftest-collection-item1\n10.5555/pdftest-collection-item2\n10.5555/pdftest-collection-item3\n10.5555/pdftest-crossref\n10.5555/pdftest-kernelmetadata\n10.5555/pdftest-multires\n10.5555/pdftest-rights\n10.5555/pdftest-version\n</pre>\n<p>make use of the following handle types (periods and underscores used as below)</p>\n<pre>COLLECTION\nCOLLECTION_ITEM\nHS_ADMIN\nHS_MODIFIED\nHDL_MD\nHDL.RIGHTS\nHDL.XREF\n</pre>\n<p>There is some degree of variability here which presumably will be managed better with a central handle type registry.</p>\n<p><strong><em>DOI/Handle</em></strong></p>\n<p>And lastly, this demo raises questions again about DOI and handle boundaries. From a handle viewpoint a DOI is nothing more than a branded handle, whereas from a DOI viewpoint a DOI is a specific handle profile with governance and policies, and its own service portfolio. The two terms should not be used interchangeably which I fear is where some of the demo details would lead us. As a very crude analogy (and with apologies to Bob Kahn) but I would see the relationship between DOI and handle as not being dissimilar from that between TCP and IP.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Metadata in PDF: 3.

And, on the flip side, how can we make it easier for consumers to extract metadata we have embedded in our PDFs.</p>\n<p>Below are some considerations on deploying metadata in PDFs and consumer access.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Write New</em></strong></p>\n<p>Obviously the best option would be to speak to one’s suppliers and to get metadata added to the PDF at create time. This leads to questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What metadata do we have available in the workflow process? Do we have the full set we wish to write, or just a subset?\n<ul>\n<li>Do we include metadata in the document information dictionary, or in the document metadata stream, or both?\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>OK, so we’ve decided to (also) include an XMP packet. So, now do we make that XMP packet read only or write? That is, do we allow the possibility of further edits by adding in trailing whitespace and marking it as “write”? </ul>\n<strong><em>Write Update</em></strong></p>\n<p>What possibilities exist for updating legacy PDF archives?</p>\n<p>The cleanest means of updating a PDF is in-place edits. This maintains the number of PDF objects together with their lengths and byte offests. Specifically we are interested in metadata objects. There isn’t too much one can do with the document information dictionary apart from overwriting a field value or substituting a field. This is something that may be possible on a “one off” basis only. On the other hand, XMP packets are ripe for updating if they are set in “write” mode and have trailing whitespace. This can be used to supplement the metadata already contained in the packet.</p>\n<p>There is some “wiggle” room, however, even in read-only XMP packets which have no trailing whitespace. Some XMP packets may include unused default namespace declarations and/or empty elements. These could be safely stripped and used for more positive purposes. This may not be enough to write in a full metadata set, but could be enough to squeeze in the DOI.</p>\n<p>The usual way to update a PDF file is to append new objects. This means that a replacement document information dictionary and (document) metadata stream can be provided without worrying about shoe-horning the data into any leftover space in the original objects.</p>\n<p>And this would be just fine, but for the small matter of Linerarized PDFs. These are widely deployed as web friendly PDFs ready for byte serving and are written out in a strictly determined ordering. (See Appendix F, “Linearized PDF” in the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html\" target=\"_blank\">PDF Reference Manual</a>.) The manual does, however, say (Section F.4.6, “Accessing an Updated File”) this about updating a Linearized PDF:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>_“As stated earlier, if a Linearized PDF file subsequently has an incremental update appended to it, the linearization and hints are no longer valid. Actually, this is not necessarily true, but the viewer application must do some additional work to validate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the information.</p></p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>For a PDF file that has received only a small update, this approach may be worthwhile. Accessing the file this way is quicker than accessing it without hints or retrieving the entire file before displaying any of it.”</i></blockquote></p>\n<p>This may warrant some further investigation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Read</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now for consumers, how can publishers help users to read the metadata embedded in a file? The document information dictionary is reasobaly accessible and is in the clear. It probably would not provide for much in terms of metadata but should anyway hopefully contain the DOI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The XMP SDK is still far too unwieldy for wide use. Things would be much improved if there were even some <a href=\"http://www.swig.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SWIG wrappers</a> for more popular languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, etc. around the C++ code. The other thing to bear in mind is that the XMP SDK is dealing with generalities such as constructing and parsing XMP objects for reading and updating in a range of binary files. A consumer metadata app would only be interested in extracting the RDF/XML from the PDF. This can then be dealt with as appropriate to the application. Another problem concerns multiple XMP packets occurring in the same PDF, only one of them being the main (or document) XMP packet. This may be a non-problem in that all the RDF/XML could be extracted and the main XMP packet would be identifiable through the metadata it provided.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I suggest the best way to really help consumers is to go ahead and embed metadata in the first place, then there would be a clear impetus for extracting it. Even if a fuller metadata set is not being considered at this time, then at least the DOI should be considered for embedding in the PDF as a “hook” for further services. The handle plugin is a really good example of just such a downstream application.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":null,"title":"PRISM 2.0","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/prism-2.0/","published":"Thu, 02 Aug 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Only just caught up with this but the PRISM 2.0 draft is now available (since July 12) for public comment.

Example:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-1\" data-lang=\"1\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;&lt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Title ( PostScript Language Reference, Third Edition )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Author ( Adobe Systems Incorporated )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Creator ( Adobe FrameMaker 5.5.3 for Power Macintosh&amp;reg; )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Producer ( Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Power Macintosh )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/CreationDate ( D:19970915110347-08&#39;00&#39; )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/ModDate ( D:19990209153925-08&#39;00&#39; )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&gt;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">endobj\n</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>\n<li><strong><em>B - (Document) Metadata Stream</em></strong>\nThis is an optional object (a stream) referenced from the document catalog, itself referenced from the PDF trailer dictionary. Example:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>2 0 obj\n&lt;&lt;\n/Type /Metadata\n/Subtype /XML\n/Length 1706\n&gt;&gt;\nstream\n&lt;?xpacket begin=&#39;&#39; id=&#39;W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d&#39;?&gt;\n&lt;!-- RDF/XML goes here --&gt;\n&lt;?xpacket end=&#39;w&#39;?\n&gt;\nendstream\nendobj\n</code></pre><p>Both approaches usually make the embedded metadata in the PDF available in the clear, whereas content is frequently filtered and sometimes encrypted. (Note that the information dictionary is always in the clear, while the metadata stream can be filtered and rendered unreadable although in practice this tends not to be filtered.)</p>\n<p>Below I examine both approaches and see how they can be used to encode the kind of metadata that scholarly publishers are accustomed to.</p>\n<p><strong><em>A - Document Information Dictionary</em></strong></p>\n<p>Note that keys in the document information dictionary divide equally between the logical document description (non-asterisked keys) and the physical asset description (asterisked keys):</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>Title\nAuthor\nSubject\nKeywords\n&amp;nbsp;\n* Creator\n* Producer\n* CreationDate\n* ModDate\n* Trapped\n</code></pre><p>This is the complete listing of keys in the PDF specification, although foreign keys are allowed (and ignored).</p>\n<p>What is missing here is any document identifier and/or any other descriptive metadata. From a Crossref point of view the identifier (the DOI) is a “hook” into the metadata record and so at minimum this could usefully be added. The question then is how? Either the identifier can be squeezed into one of the existing fields (“Title”, “Author”, “Subject”, “Keywords”) or else a new foreign key could be created.</p>\n<p>IMO if an existing keyword is used then I would opt for “Subject” or “Keywords”, and probably the former. If, on the other hand, a new foreign key were to be created I would choose something generic and (in keeping with the other terms) use something like “Identifier” (rather than, say, “DOI”).</p>\n<p>Of preference, I think I would go for the latter (“Identifier”) but if one wanted to make this more robust one could think of also adding in a known term (e.g. “Subject” or “Keywords”). So, to include metadata for the news article “Cosmology: Ripples of early starlight” printed in <em>Nature</em> magazine <em>Nature 445, 37 (2007): doi:10.1038/445037a</em>, we might include the following terms in the document information dictionary as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-1\" data-lang=\"1\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;&lt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Title ( Cosmology: Ripples of early starlight )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Author ( Craig J. Hogan )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Subject ( doi:10.1038/445037a )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Keywords ( cosmology infrared protogalaxy starlight )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;b&gt;/Identifier ( doi:10.1038/445037a )&lt;/b&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Creator ( ... )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Producer ( ... )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/CreationDate ( ... )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/ModDate ( ... )\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&gt;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">endobj\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>where the bolded term represents a foreign key/value pair.</p>\n<p>Note: This (including the DOI in the “Subject” field) is a fix intended to get the DOI listed by Adobe apps which would not otherwise recognize the foreign key “Identifier”.</p>\n<p>Since it is not really feasible to include separate enumerated fields within the information dictionary (although it could be done), one might also consider including a descriptive citation field as a foreign key, e.g., something like:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>/Source (Nature 445, 37 \\(2007\\))\n</code></pre><p>Aternatively that might better be presented as the “Subject” along with the DOI. Which would then limit the number of foreign keys to one (“Identifier”).</p>\n<p><strong><em>B - (Document) Metadata Stream</em></strong></p>\n<p>The metadata stream with its use of XMP packets (wrapping RDF/XML instances) is a much more flexible approach to embedding metadata and allows multiple schemas to be used. As noted in my <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/xmp-first-hacks/\">previous post</a> here on XMP, PDFs with XMP packets mostly use media-specific terms and schemas, although there is also a token showing of DC. From a descriptive metadata point of view we would more likely make use of DC and PRISM for our schemas.</p>\n<p>Reprising the example from the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/xmp-first-hacks/\">previous post</a> (and again using citation example listed above) this would mean we may be inclined to include the following terms for a scholarly work (here in RDF/N3 for readability):</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-dc:creator\" data-lang=\"dc:creator\">dc:title &#34;Cosmology: Ripples of early starlight&#34; ;\ndc:identifier &#34;doi:10.1038/445037a&#34; ;\ndc:source &#34;Nature 445, 37 (2007)&#34; ;\ndc:date &#34;2007-01-04&#34; ;\ndc:format &#34;application/pdf&#34; ;\ndc:publisher &#34;Nature Publishing Group&#34; ;\ndc:language &#34;en&#34; ;\ndc:rights &#34;© 2007 Nature Publishing Group&#34; ;\n&amp;nbsp;\nprism:publicationName &#34;Nature&#34; ;\nprism:issn &#34;0028-0836&#34; ;\nprism:eIssn &#34;1476-4679&#34; ;\nprism:publicationDate &#34;2007-01-04&#34; ;\nprism:copyright &#34;© 2007 Nature Publishing Group&#34; ;\nprism:rightsAgent &#34;permissions@nature.com&#34; ;\nprism:volume &#34;445&#34; ;\nprism:number &#34;7123&#34; ;\nprism:startingPage &#34;37&#34; ;\nprism:endingPage &#34;37&#34; ;\nprism:section &#34;News and Views&#34; ;\n</code></pre><p>This would look something like the following as an XMP packet within a PDF metadata stream (the RDF now being serialized as RDF/XML):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-2\" data-lang=\"2\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;&lt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Type /Metadata\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Subtype /XML\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">/Length 1706\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&gt;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">stream\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;?xpacket begin=&#39;&#39; id=&#39;W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d&#39;?&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&#34;&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&#34;&#34;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">xmlns:dc=http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">&lt;dc:creator&gt;Craig J.

I would, however, quibble with the use of “HDL” as a foreign key for the information dictionary. I realize this is just a test but the term “HDL” (or “DOI”, for that’s what it really is) is somewhat specific and a more general term such as “Identifier” would probably have more mileage, e.g.</p>\n<pre>5 0 obj\n&lt;&lt;\n...\n<b>/Identifier (doi:10.5555/pdftest-crossref)</b>\n...\n&gt;&gt;\nendobj\n</pre>\n<p>In the second example from the metadata dictionary I don’t think the term “HDL” from the PDF extension schema “pdfx” is very helpful. (Is that namespace actually defined anywhere?) From a descriptive metadata viewpoint a more usual schema such as DC would have wider coverage. So again the second example would be better rendered as</p>\n<pre>&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=\"\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"&gt;\n<b>&lt;dc:identifier&gt;doi:10.5555/pdftest-crossref&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;</b>\n&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>or, alternately,</p>\n<pre>&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=\"\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"&gt;\n<b>&lt;dc:identifier&gt;info:hdl/10.5555/pdftest-crossref&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;</b>\n&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n</pre>\n<p><strong><em>Elsevier</em></strong></p>\n<p>Well, we have Alexander Griekspoor’s <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/xmp-first-hacks/\">comment earlier</a> that Elsevier are including the DOI in their PDFs. I don’t know how consistently this is being done but I’ve checked a couple sample articles and it would seem that they have embedded the DOI (here from <em>Cancer Cell, doi:0.1016/j.ccr.2007.06.004</em>) in the title element which shows up in the information dictionary as</p>\n<pre>361 0 obj\n&lt;&lt;\n/Producer (Adobe LiveCycle PDFG 7.2)\n/Creator (Elsevier)\n/Author ()\n/Keywords ()\n<b>/Title (doi:10.1016/j.ccr.2007.06.004)</b>\n/ModDate (D:20070630031637+05'30')\n/Subject ()\n/CreationDate (D:00000101000000Z)\n&gt;&gt;\nendobj\n</pre>\n<p>and in the (document) metadata dictionary as</p>\n<pre>365 0 obj\n&lt;&lt;\n/Type /Metadata\n/Subtype /XML\n/Length 1526\n&gt;&gt;\nstream\n&lt;?xpacket begin='' id='W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d' bytes='1526'?&gt;\n&nbsp;\n&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'\nxmlns:iX='http://ns.adobe.com/iX/1.0/'&gt;\n&nbsp;\n&lt;rdf:Description about=''\nxmlns='http://ns.adobe.com/pdf/1.3/'\nxmlns:pdf='http://ns.adobe.com/pdf/1.3/'&gt;\n&lt;pdf:Producer&gt;Adobe LiveCycle PDFG 7.2&lt;/pdf:Producer&gt;\n&lt;pdf:ModDate&gt;2007-06-30T03:16:37+05:30&lt;/pdf:ModDate&gt;\n<b>&lt;pdf:Title&gt;doi:10.1016/j.ccr.2007.06.004&lt;/pdf:Title&gt;</b>\n&lt;pdf:Creator&gt;Elsevier&lt;/pdf:Creator&gt;\n&lt;pdf:Author&gt;&lt;/pdf:Author&gt;\n&lt;pdf:Keywords&gt;&lt;/pdf:Keywords&gt;\n&lt;pdf:Subject&gt;&lt;/pdf:Subject&gt;\n&lt;pdf:CreationDate&gt;0-01-01T00:00:00Z&lt;/pdf:CreationDate&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&nbsp;\n&lt;rdf:Description about=''\nxmlns='http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/'\nxmlns:xap='http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/'&gt;\n&lt;xap:CreatorTool>Elsevier&lt;/xap:CreatorTool&gt;\n&lt;xap:ModifyDate>2007-06-30T03:16:37+05:30&lt;/xap:ModifyDate&gt;\n&lt;xap:Title&gt;\n&lt;rdf:Alt&gt;\n<b>&lt;rdf:li xml:lang='x-default'>doi:10.1016/j.ccr.2007.06.004&lt;/rdf:li&gt;</b>\n&lt;/rdf:Alt&gt;\n&lt;/xap:Title&gt;\n&lt;xap:Author&gt;&lt;/xap:Author&gt;\n&lt;xap:Description&gt;\n&lt;rdf:Alt&gt;\n&lt;rdf:li xml:lang='x-default'/&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:Alt&gt;\n&lt;/xap:Description&gt;\n&lt;xap:CreateDate&gt;0-01-01T00:00:00Z&lt;/xap:CreateDate&gt;\n&lt;xap:MetadataDate>2007-06-30T03:16:37+05:30&lt;/xap:MetadataDate&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&nbsp;\n&lt;rdf:Description about=''\nxmlns='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/'\nxmlns:dc='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/'&gt;\n<b>&lt;dc:title>doi:10.1016/j.ccr.2007.06.004&lt;/dc:title&gt;</b>\n&lt;dc:creator/&gt;\n&lt;dc:description/&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&nbsp;\n&lt;/rdf:RDF>\n&lt;?xpacket end='r'?&gt;\nendstream\nendobj\n</pre>\n<p>Kudos anyway to Elsevier for emebedding this piece of information in their PDFs (if indeed it is a general practice). This has the merit of being picked up by Adobe apps and displayed in e.g. Reader. Also third party apps can pull this and use this to retrieve the metadata record from Crossref.</p>\n<p>The only downside is that technically this seems to be a kludge to satisfy Adobe apps and is not the correct field for filing this information. I would have thought that some other information dictionary field (e.g. “Subject”) would be a better kludge, and then reserve the “Title” and “Author” fields for their proper purposes. The RDF/XML title fields would appear to be inherited from the “Title” field in the information dictionary. It’s a bit of a shame really because the DOI is embedded - it’s just in the wrong place(s). (OK, so that’s still way better, maybe, than not providing this information at all.)</p>\n<p>Hopefully, with more examples to mull over and experiences to learn from we can arrive at a much better and more systematic way of including the DOI, and other key metadata fields, within a PDF so that this information can be gleaned easily and unambiguously by third party apps.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Handle Acrobat Reader Plugin","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/handle-acrobat-reader-plugin/","published":"Tue, 31 Jul 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Just announced on the handle-info list is a new plugin from CNRI for Acrobat Reader - see here.

This XML fragment with trailing XML whitespace is topped and tailed by &ldquo;<tt>&lt;?xpacket&gt;</tt>&rdquo; processing instructions with &ldquo;<tt>begin</tt>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<tt>end</tt>&rdquo; attributes, respectively.\nThe RDF supported is a simple profile of RDF with only certain constructs recognized: scalars, arrays, structures. It is not a means to embed arbitrary RDF/XML structures. But I&rsquo;ll pass on that for now. At first blush it&rsquo;s at least suitable to get a simple dictionary of key/value terms written in, and more besides.\nThe XMP metadata from the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130815224916/http://nurture.nature.com/\">PDF file</a> listed above looks as follows in RDF/N3 (which is a more chipper serialization of RDF than is RDF/XML):</pre></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;uuid:...&amp;gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>dc:creator &ldquo;x&rdquo; ;\ndc:format &ldquo;application/pdf&rdquo; ;\ndc:title &ldquo;19.7 N&amp;V.indd NEW.indd&rdquo;@x-default ;\n \npdf:GTS_PDFXConformance &ldquo;PDF/X-1a:2001&rdquo; ;\npdf:GTS_PDFXVersion &ldquo;PDF/X-1:2001&rdquo; ;\npdf:Producer &ldquo;Acrobat Distiller 6.0.1 for Macintosh&rdquo; ;\npdf:Trapped &ldquo;False&rdquo; ;\n \npdfx:GTS_PDFXConformance &ldquo;PDF/X-1a:2001&rdquo; ;\npdfx:GTS_PDFXVersion &ldquo;PDF/X-1:2001&rdquo; ;\n \nxap:CreateDate &ldquo;2007-07-16T09:25:20+01:00&rdquo; ;\nxap:CreatorTool &ldquo;InDesign: pictwpstops filter 1.0&rdquo; ;\nxap:MetadataDate &ldquo;2007-07-16T11:40:21+01:00&rdquo; ;\nxap:ModifyDate &ldquo;2007-07-16T11:40:21+01:00&rdquo; ;\n \nxapMM:DocumentID &ldquo;uuid:be3a9be5-4e3a-4b66-a50b-26f0a0bfc89d&rdquo; ;\nxapMM:InstanceID &ldquo;uuid:73dcd021-d40a-4cb7-a99b-44f8e90624f4&rdquo; .\n</pre></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;span &gt;(&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; I’ve omitted namespaces here and dropped some of the structuring info that was present on the &amp;#8220;&lt;tt&gt;dc:creator&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;&lt;tt&gt;dc:title&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;#8221; elements thus leaving all values as simple strings.

It’s a bright and breezy tutorial and useful (to me, anyway) for disclosing a couple of links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/findings\" target=\"_blank\">Findings of the W3C TAG</a>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Data - Design Issues</a> </ul>\nThe tutorial is unsurprisingly orthodox in its advocacy for all things HTTP and goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“In the context of Linked Data, we restrict ourselves to using HTTP URIs only and avoid other URI schemes such as URNs and DOIs.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But this only relates back to Berners-Lee’s piece on Linked Data referenced above in which he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“The second rule, to use HTTP URIs, is also widely understood. The only deviation has been, since the web started, a constant tendency for people to invent new URI schemes (and sub-schemes within the urn: scheme) such as LSIDs and handles and XRIs and DOIs and so on, for various reasons. Typically, these involve not wanting to commit to the established Domain Name System (DNS) for delegation of authority but to construct something under separate control. Sometimes it has to do with not understanding that HTTP URIs are names (not addresses) and that HTTP name lookup is a complex, powerful and evolving set of standards. This issue discussed at length elsewhere, and time does not allow us to delve into it here.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hmm. Does make one wonder where the concept of URI ever arose. Surely the nascent WWW application should have mandated the exclusive use of HTTP identifiers? Seems that this concept snuck up on us somehow and we now have to put it back into the box. Pandora, indeed!</p>\n<p>Back to the tutorial there are some unorthodox terms or at least I had not heard of them before. Contrasted with the defined term <strong>information resources</strong> (from <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\" target=\"_blank\">AWWW</a>) is the undefined term “non-information resources”. Further on, there’s a distinction made between two types of RDF triple: “literal triples” and “RDF links”. I hadn’t heard of either of these terms before although they are presented as if they were in common usage. The tutorial then goes on to deprecate the use of certain RDF features because it makes it “easier for clients”. So, I guess that the full expressivity of RDF is either not required or the world of “linked data” is not quite so large as it would like to be.</p>\n<p>And later on, there’s this puzzling injunction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“You should only define terms that are not already defined within well-known vocabularies. In particular this means not defining completely new vocabularies from scratch, but instead extending existing vocabularies to represent your data as required.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Am I wrong, or is there something of a Catch 22 there? To extend an arbitrary vocabulary I would need to be the namespace authority - to be the “URI owner” in W3C speak. But I can’t be the authority for all namespaces/vocabularies because by the intent of the above they would likely be just the one (true?) vocabulary which I may or may not be the authority for. I thought the intent of the RDF model and XML namespaces was that terms could be applied from disparate vocabularies to the description at hand.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I am not trying to knock the draft. It’s something of a curate’s egg, that’s true, but I am genuinely looking forward to reading it through and would encourage others to have a look at it too.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":null,"title":"PURL Redux","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/purl-redux/","published":"Thu, 12 Jul 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Seems that there’s life in the old dog yet. :~) See this post about PURL from Thom Hickey, OCLC, This extract: OCLC has contracted with Zepheira to reimplement the PURL code which has become a bit out of...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"thammond","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>Seems that there’s life in the old dog yet. :~) See <a href=\"http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2007/07/purl2.html\" target=\"_blank\">this post</a> about PURL from Thom Hickey, OCLC, This extract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>OCLC has contracted with Zepheira to reimplement the PURL code which has become a bit out of date over the years.

From the way in which the other meeting attendees swarmed around Toby as he was handing them out, I think that they might have had the same reaction.</p>\n<p>As we headed back to London on the Eurostar, I almost immediately popped the USB stick into my laptop and started browsing through the Factbook, much as I would have thumbed through a print version of the same (although -truth be told- I would have been tempted to conveniently “forget” the print version in order to not have to shlep it from Paris back to Oxford).</p>\n<p>In short, I think the system works. Kudos to the OECD for a simple, inexpensive and creative experiment in e-publishing.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"OASIS Announces Search Web Services TC","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/oasis-announces-search-web-services-tc/","published":"Fri, 15 Jun 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"OASIS has just announced a technical committee for standardising search services.

This document we feel has now reached a level of maturity that we wanted to share with a wider audience. We invite feedback either directly at <a href=\"mailto:ore@openarchives.org.\">ore@openarchives.org</a> or indirectly via <a href=\"mailto:t.hammond@nature.com\">yours truly</a>.</p>\n<p>The document attempts to describe the problem domain - that of describing a scholarly publication as an aggregation of resources on the Web - and to put that squarely into the Web architecture context. What the initiative is seeking to provide is machine descriptions of those resources and their relationships, something that we are inclining to call “resource maps” and as underpinning we are making use of the notion of “named graphs” from ongoing semantic web research. Essentially these resource maps are machine-readable descriptions of participating resources (in a scholarly object - both core resources and related resources) and the relationships between those resources, the whole set of assertions about those resources being named (i.e. having a URI as identifier) and having provenance information attached, e.g. publisher, date of publication, version information (still under discussion). It is envisaged that these compound object descriptions may be available in a variety of serializations from a published, object-specific URL (i.e. a good old-fashioned Web address) but some honest-to-goodness XML serialization is a likely to be one of the candidates. No surprises here, then.</p>\n<p>Below is a schematic from the paper which shows the publication of a resource map (or named graph) corresponding to the compound object which logically represents a scholarly publication. For those objects of immediate interest to Crossref these would likely be identified with DOI’s although there is no restriction in OAI-ORE on the identifier to be used - other than it be a URI.</p>\n<img alt=\"named_graph.png\" src=\"https://www.crossref.org/wp/blog/images/named_graph.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"160\" />\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> For a couple posts from some other members of the ORE TC see <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160404104320/http://dltj.org/article/thoughts-on-compound-documents/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (Peter Murray, OhioLINK) and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160410040938/http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2007/06/refining_ore.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (Pete Johnston, Eduserv).</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"RSC’s Project Prospect v1.1","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/rscs-project-prospect-v1.1/","published":"Thu, 31 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"We updated our Project Prospect articles today to release v1.1, with a pile of look &amp; feel improvements to the HTML views and links.

(And thanks to <a href=\"http://public.lanl.gov/herbertv/\" target=\"_blank\">Herbert Van de Sompel</a> for drawing attention to the paper.) Gist of it (Sect. 3) is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>_“We propose that citations to numerical data include, at a minimum, six required components. The first three components are traditional, directly paralleling print documents. … Thus, we add three components using modern technology, each of which is designed to persist even when the technology changes: a unique global identifier, a universal numeric fingerprint, and a bridge service. They are also designed to take advantage of the digital form of quantitative data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An example of a complete citation, using this minimal version of the proposed standards, is as follows:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>**Micah Altman; Karin MacDonald; Michael P. McDonald, 2005, “Computer Use in Redistricting”,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>hdl:1902.1/AMXGCNKCLU UNF:3:J0PkMygLPfIyT1E/8xO/EA==</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>http://id.thedata.org/hdl%3A1902.1%2FAMXGCNKCLU</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“_</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the abbreviated citation (author, date, title, unique ID) is supplemented by a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20061006030921/http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/UNF.html\" target=\"_blank\">UNF</a> which fingerprints the data. UNFs would appear to be a sort of super MD5 in providing a signature of the data content independent of the data serialization to a filestore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>_“Thus, we add as the fifth component a Universal Numeric Fingerprint or UNF. The UNF is a short, fixed-length string of numbers and characters that summarize all the content in the data set, such that a change in any part of the data would produce a completely different UNF. A UNF works by first translating the data into a canonical form with fixed degrees of numerical precision and then applies a cryptographic hash function to produce the short string. The advantage of canonicalization is that UNFs (but not raw hash functions) are format-independent: they keep the same value even if the data set is moved between software programs, file storage systems, compression schemes, operating systems, or hardware platforms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, since most web browsers do not currently recognize global unique identifiers directly (i.e., without typing them into a web form), we add as the sixth and final component of the citation standard a bridge service, which is designed to make this task easier in the medium term.”_</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Certainly looks promising. I’m not sure if there’s any other contestants in this arena.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Crossref Forward Linking Webinar","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-forward-linking-webinar/","published":"Thu, 29 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"The next Crossref Forward Linking Webinar is coming on Monday April 30th , 2007 at 12:00pm.

She said the goal of the meeting was really nothing more than to launch a discussion on a topic of author identifiers and hear from participants re their views and experiences on unique identifiers for individuals — be they authors, contributors, or otherwise. We went around the table and everyone introduced themselves. Amy then introduced Geoff Bilder as moderator of the meeting. Geoffrey Bilder said that Crossref’s members had indicated that they would like Crossref to explore whether it could play a role in creating an author identification system. The members feel that an “author DOI” scheme would help them with production and editorial issues. They also recognize that such a scheme could fuel numerous downstream applications. Geoff apologized for sounding like Rumsfeld and said, we know that there is a lot that we don’t know, but we don’t know exactly what we don’t know. We have just started this project and we wanted to get some feedback from various groups concerned with scholarly publishing in order to understand what people would like to see in regards to author identification schemes and what initiatives/efforts we need to be aware of. He commented that the currently assembled group failed to include the open web community, and their input would be important too as this project develops. The meeting then turned to short project summaries from others.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Summaries</strong> Jim Pringle gave a short PPT presentation (attached) and reported that Thomson first started creating its own author ids in 2000, in relation to the launch of its Highly Cited service. The focus for Thomson in this area has been on author disambiguation. Jim said that the focus for Crossref in this area would be a system that could respond to the question “who are you and what have you written”; he also raised concern about matters of author privacy.</p>\n<p>Michael Healy then discussed the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070611181723/http://collectionscanada.ca/iso/tc46sc9/27729.htm\" target=\"_blank\">International Standard Party Identifier</a> (ISPI). ISO TC 46/SC 9 is developing ISPI as a new international identification system for the parties (persons and corporate bodies) involved in the creation and production of content entities. Work on the ISPI project began in August 2006 when the New Work Item proposal was approved by the member bodies of ISO TC 46/SC 9. The first meeting of the ISPI project group was held at CISAC’s offices in Paris on September 12, 2006. This project has strong representation the library sector, RRO’s, booksellers, music and film/TV industries represented as well. Mr. René Lloret Linares from CISAC (International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) chairs the group; until now CISAC has been using a proprietary id scheme and would like to move to use of an open standard to identify all contributors and creators. Michael was asked whether membership in the project group was open, and he replied that anyone can attend meetings as observers but that voting is restricted to those nominated by their own national standards organization. Chris Shillum then asked the group to think about developed use cases for the publishing industry, and how they differ from potential ISPI applications.</p>\n<p>Helen Henderson reported on the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20071212133049/https://web.archive.org/web/20060904075439/http://www.journalsupplychain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Journals Supply Chain project</a>, a pilot that aims to discover whether the creation of a standard, commonly used identifier for Institutions (customer ids) will be beneficial to parties involved in the journal supply chain. The pilot models interactions between each party — library, publisher, agent. 35 publishers are participating thus far. Helen also said there is a clear need for sub-institutional level ids. Helen also pointed out the value of associating author and institutional ids. On the topic of institutions, Tim Ingoldsby pointed out that both academic and corporate institutions are important. Chris Rosin said Parity is working on author merger and disambiguation as core use cases of author ids for its publisher clients. In particular, they have developed automated merging of instances into profiles, proceeding with conservative bias on what constitutes a match/merge. Parity is also looking at applying author cv’s onto profiles. This will require contributors to participate, and they will need to make it as easy as possible for contributors. Chris said that authentication, trust, and privacy are key considerations; even collecting public information in one place raises privacy issues. Judith Barnsby pointed out that the UK has stronger data protection rules than the US, re privacy. Discussion among the group at this point in the meeting resulted in identifying two different areas in author id assignment — (1) ongoing assignment, (2) retroactive assignment. Geoff said this distinction was useful for Crossref, who could more easily address ongoing assignment via publishers working directly with authors.</p>\n<p>Neil Smalheiser, a neuroscientist at UIC, reported on the <a href=\"http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Arrowsmith Project</a>, a statistical model based on multiple features of the Medline database. The goal of the model is to predict the probability that any two papers are written by the same person. The project’s “Authority” tool weighs criteria such as researcher affiliation, co-author names, journal title, and medical subject headings to identify the papers most likely written by a target author. For details: arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/index.html <a href=\"http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/index.html</a></p>\n<p>David Williamson of LoC said he was working on name authority files, using ONIX metadata. Barbara Tillet of LoC spoke about authority files and related efforts in library world, which uses the control number, one type of unique id. She reported that IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations) has a group working on how to share authority numbers, which has actually been in discussion since the 1970s; there is to be an IFLA-IPA meeting in April 2007. The library community is eager to share what it knows and what it has developed this far. Barbara suggested that use of Dublin Core format here may be the best way to go. Different communities will no doubt need different ids. What is needed in the library community is an international, multi-lingual solution, based on unicode, connecting regional authority files. Publishers will want to take advantage of library author-ity files for retrospective identifications.</p>\n<p>Thomas Hickey of OCLC mentioned the <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/identities/\" target=\"_blank\">WorldCat Identity service</a>, which summarizes information for 20 million authors searchable in WorldCat. Gerry Grenier reported that IEEE was about to implement its own author disambiguation and id system, and he offered that this metadata could be fed into a Crossref system. Different participants had different views on whether the goal here should be a “light and non-centralized” (or federated) approach versus a centralized registry with one place to link authors across all publishers, versus a hybrid — centralized source to handout unique id, but publisher data could be distributed. There could also be a network of registration agencies working in a federated system. Different participants also had different views on Crossref’s role. Several publishers at the meeting supported Crossref’s role, especially in the STM space, whereas there was concern raised among some parties about whether Crossref was an appropriate choice for a system that will need to be “available everywhere to everybody”, and others re-iterated the importance of giving the academic community a voice in the development of such a service Discussion then turned to use cases — the question being, what problems would having an author id help you solve in your organization?</p>\n<p><strong>USE CASES ARTICULATED AT MEETING:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For RROs, known use case is to facilitate distribution of monies owed to authors;;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for booksellers, disambiguation in search;;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to understand the provenance of documents;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>search — to find works for particular person; self presentation — how can I effectively present myself and my work to the world?;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cross-walks — associating various life sciences ids, such as PubChem;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>identity of society members;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>identity of research funding institutions;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>disambiguation and attribution;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>linking authors and institutions;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for enhancing peer review system — need unique ids to share information with various departments;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to better know the value of our authors — for activities such as peer review, tracking stats on authors, article downloads, and individualized or personalized services;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with a central registry, author only has one place they have to update their information;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>authors will want the information to be portable when they move from inst to another — “where is Jeff Smith now?” is one such question;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to associate connected authors with one another;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to aggregate info on where (what institution) research is being done on a particular topic;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>privacy can be enhanced with author DOIs;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sharing info from library to library;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cluster all the works of a particular person for search purposes;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>stats about authors — “how many times has this author tried and been rejected from Nature?” for instance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**NEXT STEPS: Please watch the CrossTech blog for ongoing discussion **</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Microsoft to Support OpenID","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/microsoft-to-support-openid/","published":"Thu, 08 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Kim Cameron, Microsoft’s Identity Czar and member of the Identity Gang, comments on Microsoft’s announcement that they will support OpenID.

As does Pete Johnston of Eduserv <a href=\"http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2007/01/more_ore.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/\" target=\"_blank\">OAI-ORE</a> is being positioned as a companion activity to the more familiar <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/\" target=\"_blank\">OAI-PMH</a> protocol for metadata harvesting. OAI-ORE relates to the expression and exchange of digital objects across repositories rather than just the exchange of metadata about those objects.</p>\n<p>The basic problem is that scholarly communication deals in units which are compound resulting from a complex of documents and/or datasets expressed in multiple formats, versions, relationships, etc. The underlying web architecture provides a fairly simple model of resources (identified with URIs) which are interconnected and can be interacted with by retrieving representations of those resources. In practice, this usually results in unique URIs (and thus resources) for each representation - think of one URI for an HTML document, another for a PDF document of the same work, and yet new URIs for those same document formats for a new version of the work. Clearly, all these representations (or documents) are related, and more importantly relate to a single underlying “work”. Web architecture as generally practiced does not provide ready mechanisms to aggregate (and compartmentalize) related documents and datasets.</p>\n<p>My fairly simple mental picture is that the web landscape is rather like the early universe in which energy (and matter) is distributed uniformly and there is little local “intelligence” which is gradually built up through time by matter formation and aggregations of this matter leading to the more familiar “clumpy” universe with its recognizable galaxies, stars and other objects. This “clumpiness” is precisely what we are missing in the scholarly web.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"An Open PDF?","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/an-open-pdf/","published":"Mon, 29 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Adobe announces today the following: “SAN JOSE, Calif. — Jan. 29, 2007 — Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced that it intends to release the full Portable Document Format (PDF) 1.7...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"thammond","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>Adobe announces today the following:</p>\n<p><em>“SAN JOSE, Calif. — Jan. 29, 2007 — Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced that it intends to release the full Portable Document Format (PDF) 1.7 specification to AIIM, the Enterprise Content Management Association, for the purpose of publication by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).”</em></p>\n<p>The full press release is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070202072839/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200701/012907OpenPDFAIIM.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>(Via <a href=\"http://www.tkachenko.com/blog/archives/000657.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oleg Tkachenko’s Blog</a>.)</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Jon Udell and DOIs","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/jon-udell-and-dois/","published":"Mon, 29 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Not to get too self-referential here, but it was very cool to see that Tony Hammond has managed to get Not to get too self-referential here, but it was very cool to see that Tony Hammond has managed to get...","isPermalink":false,"tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"admin","url":null}],"image":null,"modified":null,"contentHtml":"<p>Not to get too self-referential here, but it was very cool to see that Tony Hammond has managed to get <a href=\"http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/01/29/the-persistent-blogosphere/\" target=\"_blank\">Not to get too self-referential here, but it was very cool to see that Tony Hammond has managed to get</a> This based on a <a href=\"http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/01/26/a-conversation-with-tony-hammond-about-digital-object-identifiers/\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a> interview with Tony posted on January 26th.</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"W3C Recs for XML - Eight of ‘Em!","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/w3c-recs-for-xml-eight-of-em/","published":"Thu, 25 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Although most folks will already know about this it still seems significant enough to blog the arrival of XQuery 1.0, XSLT 2.0, and XPath 2.0.

The pilot is being extended into 2007 and there is clearly value for publishers in having an unique ID for institutions at the licensing unit level. Ringgold, one of the project partners, has a great database with a validated hierarchy of institutions from consortia down to departments - I had a demo at Frankfurt. The report has some info on benefits for publishers and on possible business models. I think a central, neutral registry of unique IDs would be a real benefit to the industry.</p>\n<p>From the report:</p>\n<p>“Publishers</p>\n<p>Certainly publishers are already using an institutional identifier internally with major</p>\n<p>marketing and customer communication benefits. The main areas where the proposed</p>\n<p>identifier could add value to the communication between the publisher and customer</p>\n<p>should be in areas such as:</p>\n<p>• accurate COUNTER usage reports</p>\n<p>• institutional renewals being unrecognized as such and therefore appearing as</p>\n<p>new subscriptions</p>\n<p>• easier ability to track institutional end-users of consolidated subscriptions</p>\n<p>(especially those where the agent does not deliver orders via ICEDIS</p>\n<p>structured FTP with Type 2 addresses incorporated in the complete record)”</p>\n<p>On business models:</p>\n<p>“A sensible business model would have those that receive the most economic benefit</p>\n<p>from a respective service providing a respective level of funding to support costs. It is</p>\n<p>clear that publishers are the primary beneficiaries of the institutional identifier, with</p>\n<p>clear benefits, thereby suggesting they should bear the proportionate cost. Ultimately</p>\n<p>the subscriber pays anyway; economies are reflected in reduced cost to the subscriber</p>\n<p>in a competitive market.</p>\n<p>Other participants would see service improvements, but not the same clear benefits. It</p>\n<p>would therefore be reasonable to ask the publishers to bear the major cost of the</p>\n<p>establishment of such an identifier, and to a certain extent they have already done so</p>\n<p>by subscribing selectively to Ringgold’s existing auditing and database services.</p>\n<p>The various and relevant business revenue streams might be reflected as follows:</p>\n<p>• Free service: limited search only, with number of searches per day restricted,</p>\n<p>possibility of searchers to edit or input information using a “response form”</p>\n<p>designed for such purposes</p>\n<p>• Basic subscription: unlimited search access to the database</p>\n<p>• Database license for hosting services: download of standard selected metadata</p>\n<p>• Database license for publishers: access for download of selected metadata, and</p>\n<p>automatic receipt of alerts for changes”</p>"},{"id":null,"title":"Ruby Makes A-List","link":"https://www.crossref.org/blog/ruby-makes-alist/","published":"Thu, 12 Oct 2006 00:00:00 +0000","description":"Um, well.

Semantic Web discussion at the AAAI (American Association for Artificial Intelligence) featured plenty of confrontation and even some rational argument, but it may chiefly be remembered as the day when Google responded to the challenge of semantic web thinking by saying that the semantic web movement did not matter - thereby demonstrating that it did.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>by David Worlock, Chairman</p>\n<p>And we thought that the real battle this year was between net neutrality and the network owners. Or between those who think that click fraud crucially undermines Google, and those who think it doesn’t matter. We were wrong. July’s “Thrilla in Manila” was the discussion between Tim Berners-Lee and the Google Director of Search, Peter Norvig, at the Boston AAAI meeting. And it is an important moment because Berners-Lee’s assertion that the last semantic web building blocks are moving into place comes at exactly the time when Google seems anxious to diminish semantic web searching. It is a good guess that the latter results from a stimulus dictated by threat. A world where keyword searching was reduced to ground floor in a building of many storeys where it may even be an advantage to be a new market entrant with no history is a world where Google would have to progressively re-invent itself. And what is more difficult, in the recent history of these things, than a company created by a technology re-inventing itself in terms of a new technology?</p>\n<p>So Google’s Boston blows were first of all aimed at the reality test. Like STM publishers pointing to the unlikelihood of academic researchers adding metadata to articles for repository filing, Google pointed to user and webmaster incompetence as the chief reason why semantic interoperability was doomed to a long, slow and painful generative process. If users cannot configure a server or write HTML, how can they understand all this stuff? And then suppliers would slow it down by trying to make it proprietary. And then, machine to machine interoperability would encourage deception (obviously the click fraud business is hurting). The answer to the Semantic Web, from a Google stance, thus appears to be: very interesting, but not very soon.</p>\n<p>Dancing like a bee and stinging like a butterfly, Tim Berners-Lee clearly had the answers to this. The reason why the semantic web appears threatening to those who have entrenched tenancies in search is probably because it is going quicker than expected. His original ‘layer cake’ diagram, a feature on the conference circuit for five years, could now be completed at all levels. RDF as a data language is now well-established (think of RSS). Ontologies, mostly in narrow vertical domains, are moving into place, though there may be issues about relating them to each other. Query and rules languages now populate the other layers, with one of the former, SPARQL, emerging this year as a W3C candidate recommendation (6 April 2006). In a real sense this is the missing link which makes the Semantic Web a viable proposition, and at the same time joins it to the popular hubbub around Web 2.0. If part of the latter dream is data sourcing from a wide variety of service entities to create new web environments from composite content, then SPARQL sitting on top of RDF looks closest to realising that idea. In an important note in O’Reilly XML.com (SPARQL: Web 2.0 Meet the Semantic Web; 16 September 2005), Kendall Clark wrote “Imagine having one query language, and one client, that lets you arbitrarily slice the data of Flickr, del.icio.us, Google, and your three other favourite Web 2.0 sites, all FOAF files, all of the RSS 1.0 feeds (and, eventually, I suspect, all Atom 1.0 feeds) plus MusicBrainz etc”.</p>\n<p>Imagining that might well impel you into the ring with Tim Berners-Lee. If Google has to be re-invented, the process of recognition of change has to be slowed. Denying the speedy reality of the semantic web becomes essential while furious R&amp;D takes place. And content and information service providers are not just spectators of this, but participants too.</p>\n<p>© Electronic Publishing Services</p>\n<!-- links broken, not in wayback machine\n>From the EPS archive\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-\nTopix.net: semantic web building block?
