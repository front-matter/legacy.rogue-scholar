For example, <a href=\"https://oa.report/?ref=blog.oa.works\">OA.Report</a> created customized, read-to-send emails for the foundation so it could ask authors to self-archive their paywalled paper in a repository. After 380 requests, 50% of authors unpaywalled their work, with many authors self-archiving more papers than requested. Even where authors didn&#x2019;t share their work, there were still gains that could be built upon. The links in our emails were opened in 85% of our emails, which means we&#x2019;re confident the vast majority of authors contacted were educated about the policy, their article's status, and how to comply. A holistic approach enabled these results, with <a href=\"https://oa.report/?ref=blog.oa.works\">OA.Report</a> making it easy for foundation staff to take action, <a href=\"https://shareyourpaper.org/?ref=blog.oa.works\">ShareYourPaper</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/?ref=blog.oa.works\">Rights Retention Strategy</a> making it easy for authors to comply, and <a href=\"http://oa.support/?ref=blog.oa.works\">OA.Support</a> making it easy to follow up and provide support for any remaining challenges.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zx90g9mObaTCDM-G0fehda5R08yMY41z-93qgbWnx3IL7leSyOcHOVGZOEEy7EGZu1cI8idifNm-D0lb1aQNgPyHwcf4RHtOh7JwhIaVQzN0083UjKktj8kT-G40ZTRffOCYfZMlezRbEWtPrngK94E9OpIFF-jY3-SgcIVCDIRxQ3lpoVFwgj1b_X9Z5A\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"OA.Report helps funders measure and increase OA policy compliance and their investment&#x2019;s impact\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>OA.Reports actions now go further than emailing authors to target other essential actors.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://oa.report/?ref=blog.oa.works\">OA.Report</a> works by providing a dashboard, updated daily, with key insights shown and one-click actions to take.

But I didn&#x2019;t think the next pandemic would happen so soon. </p><p>Today, I&#x2019;m going to tell you a story about what I knew then, but didn&#x2019;t say.</p><p>And that is that open is not the same as fair. It is not the same as equity. </p><p>I think that open science can foster equity when it helps marginalized people learn about and research topics important to them and their communities, have their research recognized and rewarded, and translated into impact for their communities.</p><p>These are all big, complex discussions. As they should be. Today though, I&#x2019;m going to try to keep things simple. Over the next paragraphs, I&#x2019;ll share my experience of where open science did those things for me, and where it didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I shouldn&#x2019;t have to tell you that a huge number of people are traditionally excluded from taking part in research. I am one of those people.</p><p>I am currently based in the UK but I was born and raised in Nicaragua, a country with a long history of political repression. The situation back home has not been stable for a while, but the 2018 political crisis made matters worse. The social, economic, and political instability has forced more than 100,000 Nicaraguans to leave the country, producing one of the biggest migratory crises in Latin America history. My mom and dad were part of that wave of migrants. As a result, my family of 5 is now based in 4 different countries. </p><p>As a Latina woman who grew up in an unstable environment, I&#x2019;ve always had questions about what caused it. The social problems I saw demanded answers.</p><p>As Nicaragua's regimen started repressing protestors in 2018, I worried about the mental health impact of forced displacement on my friends and family, and I turned to research to learn more about it. But the publishing system was not designed with people like me in mind, and the only way for me to find answers to my questions was through open science. Tools built by organisations like OA.Works helped me get access to research in a broken system. These tools are what allowed me to read papers on migration at a very early stage in my career. Without them, I wouldn't know as much about migration as I do today.</p><p>Now, I knew about these tools because I helped build them, but not everyone can find out about them that way. I was able to learn about my interests thanks to people who had previously shared their work openly. I might not have been able to do it otherwise. As part of the OA movement, we need to do a lot more work to get this content into more people&#x2019;s hands. Even though open science facilitated my research, I could not look beyond what it was allowing me to read, so I still found myself facing many challenges to help solve the issues that were relevant to me. </p><p>Today I&#x2019;m doing an epidemiology course in the middle of the Covid pandemic, but Covid is not my priority. While everyone else is thinking about Covid, I&#x2019;m still thinking about the problems that affect the places where my family and I have lived and have had ties to for generations. </p><p>Migration has huge implications for public health, but the health of migrants has been largely overlooked in research and policy. It also has a strong connection to climate change. It is expected that by 2050, the stock of international migrants worldwide could reach 405 million. Out of those, around 200 million are expected to be displaced by climate change. The migration crisis is one of the biggest human rights issues of our time, yet, very little research has been done in this area. As a migrant, I want to help change that. &#xA0;</p><p>For my masters degree dissertation, I&#x2019;m using open data to look at the impact of paternal emigration on children &#x2018;left-behind&#x2019;. The Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition survey is a study that has been following a cohort of Filipinas who gave birth between 1983 and 1984 in Cebu, and their offspring. The study was originally conceptualized to understand infant feeding patterns, but thanks to its accessibility, it has been used to study other topics, such as sexual and reproductive health, mental health, and factors associated with the development of NCDs, such as diabetes and heart disease. The Cebu website has identified 257 publications that have used their data, but a google scholar search finds around 681 results. All of these research outputs have been possible because of the efforts of the study organizers, who were pioneers in opening up health data when it was not common to do so. </p><p>Without open data, I would not be able to conduct this study. It would not be affordable, and as an early career researcher, it would be hard to get the support I need to help guide my research. I would not be able to access what was previously closed to me, and help to answer the questions I was asking before. Open data makes it possible for me to explore systemic problems in the communities I am from.</p><p>That said, I still had to move continents and get scholarships to be able to get the skills and know how to use the data.</p><p>I am extremely fortunate to be affiliated to an institution that has the funds to help me overcome the barriers that would have prevented me from having my research read and recognized. I also have access to an institutional repository where I can share my work as soon as it is available. Not many people from my background have this option. </p><p>For example, the official journal of the Royal Society of Public Health, one of the most respected journals in my field, has an APC of $2800. &#xA0;For context, the $2800 price tag is 1.3 times higher than Nicaragua&#x2019;s GNI per capita. The publishing system harms equity by forcing researchers without funding to choose between being seen and being rewarded.</p><p>Even though there&#x2019;s not enough data for me to study the impact of paternal emigration &#xA0;on Nicaraguan children, &#xA0;I can get a lens on it because there is data on The Philippines . By opening up all aspects of my research, I hope to help others get answers to the questions that are important to them and their communities. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/2021/09/128178381-1ca91ddb-784e-4868-a7ca-a719a9ee69cb.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"OA.Works&#x2019; Natalia Norori Goes Back to the UN to Talk about Equity and Open\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1250\" srcset=\"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/128178381-1ca91ddb-784e-4868-a7ca-a719a9ee69cb.png 600w, https://blog.oa.works/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/128178381-1ca91ddb-784e-4868-a7ca-a719a9ee69cb.png 1000w, https://blog.oa.works/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/128178381-1ca91ddb-784e-4868-a7ca-a719a9ee69cb.png 1600w, https://blog.oa.works/content/images/size/w2400/2021/09/128178381-1ca91ddb-784e-4868-a7ca-a719a9ee69cb.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>There are around 7.8 billion people in the world, and only about 1.3 billion of them speak english. 75% scientific papers are published in English. &#xA0;Solo 16% de las personas puede leerlos y entenderlos. English is not my first language, and the same is true for lots of researchers out there that want to contribute to science, but they can&#x2019;t, because they don&#x2019;t speak the &#x201C;lingua franca&#x201D; of the scientific community. By translating my work to spanish, I can help lower the language barriers that prevent a subgroup of researchers whose mother tongue is not english from being part of the conversation. This, combined with opening up my research methods, fosters reproducibility. In the future, I hope someone with the similar problems I faced can build upon my experience working in the open, share their work openly as well, and feed the chain in ways that make open science the norm. </p><p>Open science has been very good for the pandemic because it enabled us to research faster, and much of it has been open, but that does not mean the research's outcomes have been equally distributed. I came here to say and show how we can help solve COVID & climate fairly and equitably by designing open thoughtfully. To be able to apply lessons learned from Covid to climate change, the movement needs to work in ensuring that those who have the important questions can access and produce research, and transform it into real world impact for the people they care about. </p><p>Today I&#x2019;ve tried to use my life story as a lens to prove that being open is not always the same as being fair and equitable. But I&#x2019;m not saying that open could never be fair and equitable, because truth be told, I honestly think that one day it could be. </p><p>Thanks so much to the UN for inviting me, it&#x2019;s been an honor to come back.<br></p>"},{"id":"60e40acda55efb003b904ca8","title":"OA.Works receives $1.9 million to bolster OA policies","link":"https://blog.oa.works/grant-to-bolster-oa-policies-from-bmgf/","published":"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 13:25:41 GMT","description":"Investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation creates a new partnership and open tools for OA policy implementation and self-archiving.","isPermalink":false,"tags":["major-news","OA.Report"],"authors":[{"name":"OA.Works","url":null}],"image":"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/2021/07/122560099-12609e80-d038-11eb-8f4b-9e54963f320a-1.gif","modified":null,"contentHtml":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/2021/07/122560099-12609e80-d038-11eb-8f4b-9e54963f320a.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"OA.Works receives $1.9 million to bolster OA policies\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1012\" height=\"506\"><figcaption><em>OA.Works and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are partnering.</em></figcaption></figure><img src=\"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/2021/07/122560099-12609e80-d038-11eb-8f4b-9e54963f320a-1.gif\" alt=\"OA.Works receives $1.9 million to bolster OA policies\"><p>We&#x2019;re thrilled to announce that OA Works (<a href=\"https://blog.oa.works/open-access-button-is-now-oa-works/\">formerly Open Access Button</a>) has received a grant of $1.9M USD over the next three years from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

As 2020 came to an end, <a href=\"https://blog.oa.works/joining-forces-with-the-founder-of-the-wikipedia-library/\">Jake Orlowitz</a> caught up with her.</p><p><strong>How did you get started in librarianship? What's your current role?</strong></p><p>It was a meandering path to scholcomm. I decided I wanted to be a librarian after earning a graduate degree in political science. I did a lot of backpacking. Then I decided I wanted to get a graduate degree that would let me learn forever, as part of my job. And, librarianship won out.</p><p>When I got to library school, I thought I would work with children, but I wound up simultaneously on the academic track. So I was showing up to academic sessions with picture books. It gave me a really broad foundation. I interned at Columbia with the repository librarian, and it seemed like the most interesting position at the time. It ended up being a really great experience&#x2014;getting to catalogue but also be in a room with all these cool people doing cool stuff&#x2014;and I got really excited about repository work. This was in 2012, when Orchid got their millionth user and Altmetrics was just being invented. I graduated, and I took a job in children's librarianship in Chappaqua, New York, and it was so fun&#x2014;sitting on the floor blowing bubbles and reading books to kids&#x2014;but I knew I couldn't do that forever.</p><p>Montana State hired me based on my internship. They set up a DSpace repository for me and said, \"Make this happen.\" Once the repository got figured out, I had the broad capacity to just build the rest of my job. My whole job is <em>what I think </em>we should be doing here. It's a pretty awesome position.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/2021/04/leila.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"An interview with the Scholcomm Librarian behind ShareYourPaper.org\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/leila.png 600w, https://blog.oa.works/content/images/2021/04/leila.png 960w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><strong>How did you end up working on Shareyourpaper.org?</strong></p><p>I first became aware of <a href=\"https://openaccessbutton.org/libraries?ref=blog.oa.works\">Open Access Button</a> through the <a href=\"https://opencon.community/?ref=blog.oa.works\">OpenCon Librarian calls</a>. I was a new-ish scholcomm librarian and was the only scholcomm librarian in the state&#x2014;super isolated. Those calls were really, really nice, as I was trying to figure out what kind of services to offer.</p><p>I attended OpenCon in Berlin and bumped into Joe at 1:30 a.m. during Karaoke. People are singing and drunk&#x2014;and I didn't know him personally&#x2014;but he was looking for serious feedback at the party. I had something to say, and he listened, seriously. And that was dedication. That was a highlight for me, and it made me feel like Joe was someone worth spending serious time with.</p><p>Back home, we started talking about ShareYourPaper (though it didn't have that name yet). At MSU, I&#x2019;d built a lightweight <a href=\"https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16790/18350?ref=blog.oa.works\">metadata capture system</a>, and we started talking about what that means and what it's good for&#x2014;what problems it could solve. ShareYourPaper seems to have just \"fallen\" out of that, as a way to solve that problem and ones like it.</p><p><strong>What did you learn about repositories while building ShareYourPaper.org?</strong></p><p>One thing that I learned was how risk assessment in terms of copyright is so different from library to library and repository to repository. I knew I had a broader or more idealistic interpretation about copyright and permissions licensing, and there are a lot of libraries who are much more conservative in their assessment&#x2014;either because they know a lot or they don't know enough.</p><p>The amount of metadata that people add to repositories surprised me, and I remain curious as to how effective and beneficial that work is. Something that was solidified for me about repositories was that we use the same language like we're doing the same thing, but often our processes vary among tools (or not tools), and we&#x2019;re coming at things from different ways. Libraryland is full of surveys, but what sounds the same can be not the same thing at all. That was a little scary, and a little exciting.</p><p><strong>It's pretty progressive to test something like that on your own institution; what makes you more likely to experiment?</strong></p><p>Montana State is a pretty small R1 university, so I tend to think of us as \"scrappy.\" We do a lot, but a lot of it is high-commitment, low-budget work. That's what we can do. Even though the library is very small, we have a lot of people who are committed to trying new things, and there's a culture of building tools to solve problems, even if they don't necessarily work. There's a lot of support for trying new things, which I know is not necessarily every library. Our dean, Kenning Arlitsch, sees the importance of repositories, and that works in my favor. I feel pretty lucky to be in a spot where I can try new things and they can be celebrated and supported.</p><p>I feel pretty strongly about green open access. And, as an optimistic but detail-oriented librarian, I liked seeing how things worked in publisher policies. The stupid limitations in policies get me worked up, maybe more than my peers, because I think they're a structural situation that inhibits the flow of knowledge. So I am interested in finding a way to solve that problem, just for the fairness of it, because we shouldn't have to work this hard to share information.</p><p><strong>What was the biggest challenge building ShareYourPaper.org?</strong><br>The hardest parts: 1) how to describe enough without describing too much&#x2014;the line between getting stuff done and sharing a fuller story about advocacy&#x2014;how much do people need to know before they can act&#x2014;where is that line; 2) figuring out what we can legally scale, and what people will be comfortable with us scaling. Making one-off judgements into machine-actionable tasks is a huge and scary activity. It means making sure our assumptions are really grounded in as much fact and precedent as we can.</p><p><strong>What's it been like to partner with the Open Access Button?</strong></p><p>So far almost everything where I've thought \"Hey wouldn't that be cool\" has happened or is in process. And that's not the way things normally work. The attitude that OAB projects out&#x2014;helpful, friendly, engaging persona&#x2014;is true, and that makes it all work better. The kind of help that it looks like you're going to get, is actually what happens.</p><p>A personal anecdote: a year ago I learned that Joe likes to glue ceramics back together with gold (Kintsugi), and I feel that I got kintsugi'ed. Working in scholarly communication can be discouraging&#x2014;it feels like trying to put the pieces of a system together while publishers and ingrained scholarly practices pull them apart. Having a project that worked and gave me purpose and made something better out of something broken...that's how I encapsulate our partnership. I'm pleased to learn that is a pattern, not an accident.</p><p><strong>You are going on maternity leave soon. What information access wish do you have for the next generation?</strong><br>The biggest thing I hope is that people don&#x2019;t have to think about this stuff. As much as SYP is super useful&#x2014;what if we didn't have to do this and people could just have the information that they wanted? What if people didn't have to fight against the commodification of research that my tax dollars pay for? What if everything was just free and easy to find?</p><p><br><em>Thank you to the <a href=\"https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/?ref=blog.oa.works\">Arcadia Fund</a> and <a href=\"https://openaccessbutton.org/leaders?ref=blog.oa.works\">Libraries</a> for generously supporting our work.</em></p><p></p>"},{"id":"5f7f54583647330039390b8b","title":"Shareyourpaper.org for Libraries out now.","link":"https://blog.oa.works/shareyourpaper-org-for-libraries-out-now/","published":"Wed, 06 Jan 2021 14:05:14 GMT","description":"Hereâ€™s how it works","isPermalink":false,"tags":["major-news"],"authors":[{"name":"OA.Works","url":null}],"image":"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/2020/10/submit_for_link_repeat--1-.jpg","modified":null,"contentHtml":"<img src=\"https://blog.oa.works/content/images/2020/10/submit_for_link_repeat--1-.jpg\" alt=\"Shareyourpaper.org for Libraries out now.\"><p>Today, for free, in just 30 minutes, you can <a href=\"https://shareyourpaper.org/demo?ref=blog.oa.works\">demo</a> and<a href=\"https://shareyourpaper.org/setup?ref=blog.oa.works\"> set up</a> the simplest way to legally self-archive a paper &#x2014; for any repository, at any library &#x2014; in order to get more deposits and save you time. </p><p>Read on to find out how we&#x2019;ve designed <em><a href=\"https://shareyourpaper.org/libraries?ref=blog.oa.works\">Shareyourpaper.org for Libraries</a></em> drag-and-drop deposit workflow in partnership with Montana State, which now <a href=\"http://www.lib.montana.edu/services/publication/scholarworks/?ref=blog.oa.works\">powers their repository</a>, and serves authors everywhere at <a href=\"https://shareyourpaper.org/?ref=blog.oa.works\"><strong>Shareyourpaper.org</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nG0-vIp3kTy2TTkvde8WZKyNXosjeKRzcJr2I6rJP9q-xEB16OGHDsKTlIuYgEnWU6gQ8Ee0yMrpVWezU3h5LWjACxnlrZs1CdbkpfcqshFmfgyq7eAdXfc70Gu7HV3OWWfDdl7J\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Shareyourpaper.org for Libraries out now.\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>An example of the Shareyourpaper.org workflow embedded in Montana State&#x2019;s website and outreach.

How shareyourpaper.org compares to other approaches to deposit management. We hope that it combines both and can be used alongside either!</figcaption><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We&#x2019;ve been told more than a few times that all of this sounds too good to be true. So, below, we&#x2019;ll walk you through how it works. But, don&#x2019;t take our word for it. On the demo and set-up page, you can test yourself without risking accidentally depositing papers and see what you think we might still need to improve.</p><p><strong>How we simplify following self-archiving policies</strong></p><p>Shareyourpaper.org automatically works out what version can be uploaded, checks if it actually is, and complies with other terms. Authors don&#x2019;t need to spend time finding and making sense of publisher policies, and libraries can trust that they receive the allowed version. There are two key parts to this:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Permissions Checking. </strong>We built a new database of every policy that affects self-archiving and a system that applies them to individual papers, drawing on years of experience doing manual permission checking. This means Shareyourpaper.org can unravel all the information needed to self-archive, including what version to share, when embargos end, and complete deposit statements. Doing this requires taking into account everything from publisher self-archiving policies (including their exceptions) and institutional open access policies, to individual article licensing and differences in copyright law. We&#x2019;ve manually curated the database to cover over 85% of papers, and automatically monitor thousands of policies daily in order to ensure that information never goes out of date. Our system then applies these policies to papers using data from Crossref, Microsoft Academic, Unpaywall, and the Shareyourpaper.org sign-up process. There&#x2019;s more to it, which you can learn while getting more tools for permissions checking at shareyourpaper.org/permissions.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Paper Checking.</strong> When a paper is uploaded, we analyze if it&#x2019;s a publisher PDF or a Postprint. We analyze hundreds of different signals in the file name, metadata, formatting, and contents. As a simple example, if we&#x2019;re given a Microsoft Word file, and we can find the authors&#x2019; names and the paper title in it, we can be fairly sure that it&#x2019;s the correct author-accepted manuscript. We also look for price tags, copyright holders, licenses, key dates, citation information, download statements, line spacing, figure placement, phone numbers, and more. Together, these help us understand if what&#x2019;s being deposited is the correct paper and the correct version. We&#x2019;ve validated the system against hundreds of files by hand, and hundreds of thousands of files automatically. Our sincere thanks go out to Andre Sartori at the University of Cambridge for working with us to build this system.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7XMpEdfgS09FSgXTHUsaodsnukYbehZCTVE9i47YW7Hn6A6vXMjuMTpCsf3tTRLtM2wTXvNIRDwZnHGK5DlAk7ahIvdHULV0E684iP98SD-TMTmRkTel8TJx8odk_uRaxnA_UeGI\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Shareyourpaper.org for Libraries out now.\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>The end to end deposit workflow for Shareyourpaper.org, even if authors provide the wrong version!</em></figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>How we get you more high-quality deposits</strong></p><p>We get you more deposits by making it easy, quick, and rewarding. That means asking authors only for what they can uniquely provide (usually the file), providing instant satisfaction from that work, and give them a simplified idea of the long-term benefits. While this flips traditional archiving workflows around, after years of helping authors to deposit their work, and hours spent watching them use the tool, we think it&#x2019;s the only way to meet their expectations of depositing in just a few clicks. Meeting, and even exceeding that expectation, means that it&#x2019;s much easier for librarians and faculty champions to build a culture of self-archiving on campus.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t take our word for it. Here&#x2019;s what depositors have said to us&#x2026;</p><p><em>\t&#x201C;That is super slick!&#x201D;</em><br>\t<em>&#x201C;I have uploaded 2 PDFs so far. My experience was excellent: Clear, easy, and \tquick!&#x201D;</em><br>\t<em>&#x201C;It was remarkably easy and quick to use.&#x201D;</em></p><p>To ensure that speed doesn&#x2019;t come at the expense of quality, we automatically use data from Crossref, our permissions system, and our file checking system to create rich records. They often come complete with abstracts, ORCIDs, version information, links to the final version, and all the citation information you&#x2019;d hope for. We hope this is a great jumping off point for additions that you might like to make as you ingest.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/V9DY6k90_V3PonloFpwBJlTHWn9dLq6pa4kVhw9Vyeoy8YU_Sawn0gVFgQgfpNvK-316ymG1Fjz5s_Gw8Tj_3Xe8pDFCJmRlH_T_tLDuXKqTEq4JIyigUksEiqzmlwBFyr00pOJR\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Shareyourpaper.org for Libraries out now.\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Shareyourpaper.org adapts its deposit workflow based on if the file is already Open Access, as well as the rights of the authors.

Each of these can be turned on and off.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>How we integrate with your repository and website</strong></p><p>We want Shareyourpaper.org to deepen your library's relationship with patrons and to work with your existing IR (or, the one you&#x2019;re about to migrate to).</p><p>Using our self-setup system, you can adjust the workflow to your liking, for example, choosing if you want to enable one-click dark deposits, or adding links to your terms and conditions.

For small (but mighty) repositories, we can email you the files and metadata for every deposit and, when you get a minute, you can upload each record manually. If you&#x2019;re processing a few more deposits, then we can provide you everything as a CSV for bulk upload. For larger institutions, with a bit of technical support, you can automatically ingest deposits through an OAI-PMH feed or our simple API. Whichever way you choose, deposits have already been checked and safely stored in Zenodo to give authors an accessible link, so that you can do it at your own pace without keeping anyone waiting. That also means that, even if you don&#x2019;t have a repository, you can still use Shareyourpaper.org to help authors deposit without setting up a repository.</p><p><strong>How to all works together</strong></p><p>When we&#x2019;re given a DOI, we find the paper&#x2019;s relevant metadata, check if it&#x2019;s Open Access, and see what can be legally shared, and how to do so. Depending on what we find, we&#x2019;ll show different routes to archive. That means if an author-accepted manuscript was allowed, we show simple instructions for how to archive it. If the paper is already Open Access, and you still want it in your IR, then authors can do that. After the file is uploaded, we check it, discover it can&#x2019;t be uploaded, and nudge the depositor in the right direction. When they get back on track, we give them a link to their deposit in Zenodo, complete with all the metadata. Behind the scenes, the library will get an email with the file and this information notifying them of the deposit. It can then ingest the record into its repository as it wishes. Note that, to deposit, you don&#x2019;t need to set up an account, so anyone can do the deposit as long as they have the correct file.</p><p><strong>How Shareyourpaper.org plans to be sustainable</strong><br>Everything you&#x2019;ve read about so far is community-owned, open source, and free. We&#x2019;ve committed to providing these tools forever, so nothing stands in the way of making more papers Open Access. However, sustaining and supercharging services costs money. So, libraries who are saving time and money using our tools can reinvest some of those saving back into the tools. In return, you&#x2019;ll get extra features and services to make self-archiving easier to manage and more valuable for your institution's visibility. This means features like direct deposit into your repository. We hope that you'll try Shareyourpaper.org and, if it benefits your repository, you'll <a href=\"https://openaccessbutton.org/leaders?ref=blog.oa.works\">join other leaders who are investing in our work</a> and get the <a href=\"https://shareyourpaper.org/leadership?ref=blog.oa.works\">full benefits of doing so</a>.</p>"}]}
