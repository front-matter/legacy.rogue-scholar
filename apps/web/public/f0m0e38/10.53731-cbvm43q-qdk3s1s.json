I picked this name because I liked the description in the <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rogue%20scholar\">Urban Dictionary</a>.</p><blockquote>A person with extensive knowledge pertaining to various subject matters that extends beyond formal education. This person often <strong>gathers</strong> knowledge from various sources, such as media, friends, casual reading or the internet.</blockquote><p>And I started a waitlist for people interested in having their science blog archived in the <em>Rogue Scholar</em>. There is still a lot of work to do, but I hope to launch the archive in the second quarter of 2023 with these core features:</p><ul><li>based on the <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/\">InvenioRDM</a> open source software, hosted by Front Matter</li><li>free to archive 50 blog posts per year. For larger blogs or a backfile of several years, the Rogue Scholar will charge a one-time fee of 1 â‚¬ per blog post, and I have started to work on securing additional funding for this.</li><li>Full-text search of blog content, typically not available on self-hosted blogs</li><li>DOI registration for blog posts, facilitating discovery and integration of blogs into the scholarly record</li><li>free to read and reuse forever, using the Creative Commons Attribution (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC-BY</a>) license</li><li>initially support English and German language posts</li></ul><p>The form to sign up for the waitlist is available <a href=\"https://jvinjjenjik.typeform.com/to/uxgAsHPl\">here</a>.</p> "}
