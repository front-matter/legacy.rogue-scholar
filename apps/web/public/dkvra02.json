In that paper we found no evidence of invasive pneumaticity in the basal sauropodomorphs <em>Buriolestes</em> and <em>Pampadromaeus</em>, nor in the herrerasaurid <em>Gnathovorax</em>, although we did find some pretty interesting non-pneumatic anatomy inside the vertebrae.

Early on, I expected that the origin of pneumaticity would be found in the lateral fossae in the centra of presacral vertebrae.

The best available evidence at the time showed that pneumaticity was actually pretty widespread in basal sauropodomorphs, but the most diagnostic pneumatic features were not on the centrum.

These fossae and foramina occur in taxa with and without lateral cavities in the centra, and with and without laminated neural arches, so they are probably the most consistent osteological correlates of pneumaticity across non-avian ornithodirans. The consistent appearance of vertebral pneumaticity in areas adjacent to the neural canal corroborates the hypothesis that segmental spinal arteries were crucial in “piloting” pneumatic diverticula as they developed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I never looped that back to prosauropods. For a long stretch &#8212; 10 years &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t working on prosauropods or the origin of pneumaticity, in part that was because I was working on other things, but more importantly, because I had no new data on prosauropods. Then Tito Aureliano invited me to collaborate, and here we are. </p>\n<p>What&#8217;s surprising to me about the pneumaticity in <em>Macrocollum</em> is that although some of the vertebrae have pneumatic fossae in their centra, the most consistent and most invasive pneumaticity is in the neural arches. Arguably I should have seen that coming, especially after the bit I just quoted about how pervasive is pneumaticity adjacent to the neural canal. But even after that, I thought of neural arch pneumaticity as a sort of sideshow or opening act, just warming things up before the <em>real</em> pneumatization took off in the centrum.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_20905\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20905\" data-attachment-id=\"20905\" data-permalink=\"https://svpow.com/2023/03/28/new-paper-out-today-aureliano-et-al-2023-on-pneumaticity-in-the-early-dinosaur-macrocollum/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2008,2500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"Aureliano et al 2023 fig 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=241\" data-large-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=480\" class=\"wp-image-20905 size-large\" src=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"598\" srcset=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=480 480w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=960 960w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=120 120w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=241 241w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=768 768w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/aureliano-et-al-2023-fig-3.jpg?w=822 822w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20905\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Micro-CT scan of the anterior (second) dorsal vertebra of the unaysaurid sauropodomorph <em>Macrocollum</em> (CAPPA/UFSM 0001b).

Some of the centra have deeply incised lateral fossae, which can be strikingly asymmetrical, but lots of the vertebrae have foramina up under the diapophyses that communicate with pneumatic chambers inside the neural arch. Chambers, plural, in a complex arrangement. That&#8217;s a pretty amazing thing to find in such an early sauropodomorph.  And it&#8217;s especially exciting to me because it means that possibly I&#8217;ve been conceiving of the evolution of vertebral pneumaticity precisely backwards, for decades. I&#8217;d much rather be wrong in an interesting way than right in a boring way &#8212; especially if I get to be an author on the paper that surprises me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my takeaway thought: loads of prosauropods and early theropods have fossae up under the diapophyses. Heck, externally, that&#8217;s about all you can see in <em>Macrocollum</em>. And as Yates et al. (2012) pointed out, those fossae are not often prepared completely. But CT reveals that in <em>Macrocollum</em>, those fossae house foramina that communicate with internal chambers. Maybe that form of pneumaticity is actually widespread, and we (= humans) don&#8217;t know because we haven&#8217;t scanned very many things yet. The horizon is open, and the story can only get richer and stranger from here.

I&#8217;m not even convinced it would have led us to the idea of air-sacs, if we didn&#8217;t have extant birds as a model.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt wrote back and gave me permission to write up his reply into an SV-POW! post, which you are now, obviously, reading. Here&#8217;s what he said.</p>\n<p>No, we&#8217;d have no idea about the <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2022/02/03/how-birds-breathe-in-184-words/\">flow-through lungs</a> from fossils.</p>\n<p>In fact, it&#8217;s particularly bad for birds. Big saurischian dinosaurs had lots of postcranial skeletal pneumaticity (PSP), and some extant birds have a lot of PSP, but most Mesozoic birds have limited to zero diagnostic PSP. A few have some external foramina on the vertebrae that <em>might</em> be pneumatic, but might just be lateral foramina for the equatorial arteries. It doesn&#8217;t help that most Mesozoic birds are smashed flat and often have other elements overlapping the vertebrae — most often the proximal portions of their own ribs.</p>\n<p>So ironically, even if we somehow came up with the stacked notions that (1) PSP implied air sacs, and (2) air sacs implied flow-through lungs, we&#8217;d be much more likely to infer flow-through lungs in <em>Diplodocus</em> and <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> than in <em>Archaeopteryx</em> or most other Mesozoic birds.</p>\n<p>But wait, it gets worse! The work by Colleen Farmer, Emma Schachner, and colleagues <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2013/12/11/unidirectional-airflow-in-the-lungs-of-birds-crocs-and-now-monitor-lizards/\">that demonstrated unidirectional flow in the lungs of crocs, monitor lizards, and iguanas</a> would presumably still get done, but those animals have flow-through lungs without PSP and without particularly elevated metabolisms (although monitors are trying hard). Without the example of birds showing us how that primitive flow-through system can be further refined and supercharged to power tachymetabolism, we&#8217;d still learn of flow-through lungs, but we&#8217;d have no reason to connect them to PSP or any particular metabolic strategy.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve probably mentioned this before, but it really irks me that we assume that birds are the pinnacle of lung evolution. Why? Birds survived the K/Pg extinction because they were small and could hide and eat seeds and grubs for a while, not because they had better lungs than everything else (otherwise mammals, lizards, etc. would have done even worse). To me it would be a heck of a coincidence if the one group of ornithodirans that survived — for reasons unrelated to lung function — just happened to have the most efficient lungs. It&#8217;s always been tantalizing to me that extant birds start out with 12 embryonic air sacs, which through development usually merge into the usual 9 (unpaired clavicular, and paired cervical, anterior thoracic, posterior thoracic, and abdominal sacs). This seems like an embryonic footprint of a greater diversity — and possibly even a greater complexity — of respiratory anatomy in the ancestral ornithodiran, saurischian, or theropod (or all of the above).</p>\n"},{"id":"http://svpow.com/?p=20854","title":"We were probably wrong about caudal pneumaticity in Ca13 of the Brontosaurus excelsus holotype YPM 1980","link":"https://svpow.com/2023/03/20/we-were-probably-wrong-about-caudal-pneumaticity-in-ca13-of-the-brontosaurus-excelsus-holotype-ypm-1980/","published":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:39:06 +0000","description":"This is one of those posts where the title pretty much says it all, but here&#8217;s the detailed version.

It&#8217;s being re-prepared, and Brian Curtice has seen the material close up. The news from Brian is not good: I quote some of his emails. First, on 26 January:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The 1980 caudal 13 it isn’t pneumatic. That whole hole is plaster. The 2 verts in front of it have similar damage but on the opposite side. It looks like they were damaged during preservation, excavation, or preparation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then on 27 January:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Quick caudal pneumatic update: other than the fact 1980 has a large number of what I dub nutrient foramina there isn’t any shiny surfaces, no odd sculpting, fluting, etc. the bone is exquisite in these areas but will soon be painted black.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Later that day:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was also exceptionally difficult to sometimes tell what was actual bone. Barbour [1890 — ed.] is spot on at what Marsh had done. The preparators sometimes couldn’t be sure without acetone and an air scribe… I did the best I could but my goodness it was tough and may have errors. Thus I stayed towards what I was positive on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On 3 February, I wrote back to Brian asking:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My question about the &#8220;pneumatic fossa&#8221; in caudal 13 is: why did they sculpt it like that? It would have been the simplest thing in the world to give it a simple flat lateral aspect, like the other caudals, so what made them put the fossa in? One possible answer is that that&#8217;s what the bone was actually like, but smashed up, and they &#8220;repaired&#8221; it. I guess we are unlikely ever to know.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He replied the same day:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are 3 caudals (11-13, pics attached) with similarly damaged bone, punky and smashed and &#8220;beat up&#8221;, with 11 and 12 having the damage on the left and ventral and 13 on the right. I suspect they were lying close to one another. I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was trampling, but it didn&#8217;t seem like it was from being hacked from the ground.<br />\n[&#8230;]<br />\nAs to why they did it? I suspect because 13&#8217;s damage wasn&#8217;t as jagged, they could plaster over it easier? We&#8217;ll never know for sure.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Brian sent a photo of the re-prepared caudal 13, showing &#8230; well, see for yourself:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"20866\" data-permalink=\"https://svpow.com/2023/03/20/we-were-probably-wrong-about-caudal-pneumaticity-in-ca13-of-the-brontosaurus-excelsus-holotype-ypm-1980/ypm-1980-caudal-13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2019,2692\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Brian Curtice\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS M6 Mark II\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1674823807\",\"copyright\":\"2020\",\"focal_length\":\"16\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}\" data-image-title=\"YPM 1980 caudal 13\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg?w=480\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20866\" src=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg?w=480&h=640 480w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg?w=960&h=1280 960w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg?w=113&h=150 113w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg?w=225&h=300 225w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/ypm-1980-caudal-13.jpg?w=768&h=1024 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Truthfully, I don&#8217;t find this especially compelling. But that&#8217;s about the inadequacy of photos for this kind of work. My inclination is to trust Brian&#8217;s interpretation, while wondering how Matt and I were both fooled back in June 2012 when we visited YPM together and spent significant time gazing at this caudal.</p>\n<h1>So what now?</h1>\n<p>The good news for us is that this doesn&#8217;t really change any of our arguments or conclusion in the 2013 paper. We said that there is previously undocumented evidence of caudal pneumaticity in apatosaurines[1] — and there still is, in the other specimen we figured, FMNH P25112, in our figure 9. And the significant conclusion of the papers was the intermittent and unpredictable pneumatization along the tails of sauropods is compelling evidence for extensive &#8220;cryptic pneumaticity&#8221; — that is, for soft-tissue pneumatization alongside vertebrae that did not penetrate the bone. That conclusion is still good.</p>\n<p>But still: one of the data-points we relied on in making that argument no longer looks solid, and it feels like the honest thing is to document that. It probably doesn&#8217;t warrant a follow-up paper or even an erratum. But it does warrant a blog-post, and this is it.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Brian for bringing it to our attention!</p>\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<p>[1]. In the paper we said &#8220;in <em>Apatosaurus</em>&#8220;, not &#8220;in apatosaurines&#8221;. But that was back when <em>Apatosaurus</em> was the only recognized apatosaurine, so it amounted t0 the same thing. If we were writing it in the post-Tschopp-et-al. world of today, we&#8217;d say &#8220;in apatosaurines&#8221;.</p>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Barbour, Erwin H. 1890. Scientific News: 5.

This is from R. McNeill Alexander&#8217;s wonderful book <em>Bones: The Unity of Form and Function</em>, which was published in 1994. The whole book is packed with gorgeous full-color photos like this, and you can still get new copies for cover price (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bones-Function-R-McNeill-Alexander/dp/0025836757/\">f&#8217;rinstance</a>).</p>\n<p>I remember stumbling across this image not long after I <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2019/11/22/werner-janensch-wannabe-lovefool/\">started working on sauropod vertebrae</a> back in the late 90s, and being completely taken aback by the size of the cervical ribs. Up to that point I&#8217;d mostly been grokking the long, graceful cervicals of brachiosaurs, and the ridiculously overbuilt apatosaurine cervical morphology was a real kick in the brainpan. That&#8217;s <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2018/11/30/apatosaurus-is-still-just-plain-wrong/\">well-trod ground</a> here at SV-POW!, but this is still a beautiful photo. I suspect that the vertebra has been at least somewhat restored &#8212; some of the texturing on the condyle and under the diapophyses looks suspiciously like it was applied with tools or maybe just human fingers &#8212; but in general this is a pretty faithful representation of what an apatosaur cervical looks like from the front.</p>\n<p>One thing that always strikes me about views like this is that you could take the centrum of this vertebra, strip off the neural arch and all the apophyses, and stick it through either one of the cervical ribs loops without scraping the sides. If life, the cervical rib loops held the (comparatively small) vertebral arteries and the (comparatively gigantic) intertransverse diverticula. We know this because that&#8217;s how birds are built, and because different apatosaurine specimens show pneumatic traces almost all the way around the inside of the cervical rib loop. The same is true in theropods like <em>Majungasaurus</em>, as Pat O&#8217;Connor showed in a lovely figure in his 2006 paper (O&#8217;Connor 2006: fig. 16). The volume of air in each of the paired cervical rib loops would have simply dwarfed the volume of air inside or even alongside the centrum. I wanted to visualize that better so I took my trusty old <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2007/11/03/tutorial-3-pneumaticity/\">CT cross-section of OMNH 1094</a> and pasted it on top of this vert, stretching it a bit in GIMP to improve the fit:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"20841\" data-permalink=\"https://svpow.com/2023/03/03/an-arresting-image-of-an-apatosaur-vertebra/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated/\" data-orig-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1700,1700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"AMNH apato C6 &#8211; Alexander 1994 plate 28 &#8211; annotated\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg?w=480\" class=\"size-large wp-image-20841 aligncenter\" src=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg?w=480 480w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg?w=960 960w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg?w=150 150w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg?w=300 300w, https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/amnh-apato-c6-alexander-1994-plate-28-annotated.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another thing that this photo shows nicely are the pneumatic fossae on the anterior surfaces of the cervical ribs. I&#8217;ve seen those features on loads of apatosaur cervical ribs, but I&#8217;ve never seen them discussed anywhere. I have thoughts on why those fossae are there, but that story will have to keep for another time.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Alexander, R.

It’s a good question, and one with a complicated answer. Tune in next time to find out!&#8221;</p>\n<h1>Paper 1</h1>\n<p>The truth is, I never set out to write a history paper. My goal was  very different: to belatedly write up <a href=\"http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/svpca2016/abstract.html\">my and Matt&#8217;s 2016 SVPCA presentation, How Big Did <em>Barosaurus</em> Get?</a> (Taylor and Wedel 2016). In that talk, we discussed a half-prepared jacket at BYU that contains three <em>Barosaurus</em> cervicals which are significantly larger than those of the well-known specimen AMNH 6341. And we went on to note that <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2019/06/15/supersaurus-ultrasaurus-and-dystylosaurus-in-2019-part-2-what-we-found-in-utah/\">the giant &#8220;<em>Supersaurus</em>&#8221; cervical BYU 9024 is morphologically indistinguishable from those of <em>Barosaurus</em></a>, even though it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2019/06/16/supersaurus-ultrasaurus-and-dystylosaurus-in-2019-part-2b-the-size-of-the-byu-9024-animal/\">going on for twice the size</a>.</p>\n<p>That paper (codename: superbaro) is <a href=\"https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-superbaro\">in progress</a>, and I would estimate it&#8217;s about 40% done. But in that paper, I needed to write a brief section in the introduction about AMNH 6341, the keystone specimen for <em>Barosaurus</em>, from which all our perceptions of that animal derive. And it turned out that in that section I had <em>a lot</em> to say, to the point where &#8230;</p>\n<h1>Paper 2</h1>\n<p>It became apparent that this section needed to be pulled out and become its own paper on the AMNH <em>Barosaurus</em>. As I worked on this, trying to get to the bottom of the complicated history of the mounted cast in the museum&#8217;s atrium, I got a lot of help from Peter May of Research Casting International, and from AMNH alumni Lowell Dingus and Gene Gaffney, to the point where they have all been added as authors to the ongoing manuscript.</p>\n<p>That paper (codename: baromount) is <a href=\"https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-baromount\">in progress</a>, and I would estimate it&#8217;s about 80-90% done. But in that paper, I needed to write a section on the sources of the various elements that make up the cast — they are not all from AMNH 6341, which is pretty complete as sauropods go but still has a lot of gaps. It turned out, after some poking about, that significant parts of the skeleton were <em>Diplodocus</em> casts, and that they had been made from molds taken from a concrete cast in Vernal, Utah. I started to write up the background information on this, but quickly realised that there was a lot to say, and that it needed to be extracted out into its own paper.</p>\n<h1>Paper 3</h1>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_20778\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/figure-4-bulding-the-outdoor-mount.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20778\" data-attachment-id=\"20778\" data-permalink=\"https://svpow.com/papers-by-sv-powsketeers/taylor-et-al-2023-on-the-concrete-diplodocus/figure-4-bulding-the-outdoor-mount/\" data-orig-file=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/figure-4-bulding-the-outdoor-mount.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"3663,5073\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Figure 4.

As I was working on it, I found myself constantly consulting park manager Steve Sroka, and quickly realised that the manuscript had reached the stage of being co-authored. Later in the process, significant contributions from Ken Carpenter went beyond the point of pers. comms, and he was added as a third author. (This paper also received <em>a lot</em> of help from other people, and the acknowledgements are correspondingly extensive and effusive.)</p>\n<p>So that is the origin story of yesterday&#8217;s paper. But there is another chapter in this story &#8230;</p>\n<h1>Paper 4</h1>\n<p>As I was writing the section of this paper about the original Carnegie <em>Diplodocus</em>, and in particular about the composition of the mounted skeleton from which the original molds were (mostly) made, it became apparent that this, too, was a long and complicated story. And even though that story has been told in detail multiple times (most notably by Nieuwland 2019), there was still plenty to be told. So this section needed to be pulled out of the CDoV paper (where only a brief summary remains) and become its own paper.</p>\n<p>That paper (codename: carnegie) is <a href=\"https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-carnegie\">in progress</a>, and I would estimate it&#8217;s about 90-95% done. It, too, has acquired co-authors, including Ilja Nieuwland himself and three Carnegie staff members, but cannot be completed yet as I await an important contribution from an indisposed co-author. Still, it should not be too long before that one is submitted — to be followed by baromount, and then finally superbaro.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s happened here is that a perfectly innocent morphological description paper, based on a conference abstract and a 15-minute talk, has mutated into four substantial papers (of which, admittedly, only one is published so far).</p>\n<h1>The moral of this story</h1>\n<p>One moral is that I evidently have very little idea what I am going to work on at any given point in my career. As I was putting together <a href=\"https://svpow.com/papers-by-sv-powsketeers/taylor-et-al-2023-on-the-concrete-diplodocus/\">the sidebar page on the Concrete <em>Diplodocus</em> paper</a>, I stumbled across another sidebar page titled <a href=\"https://svpow.com/mikes-open-projects/\">Mike&#8217;s open projects</a>, which I made in 2020. It lists eight projects that I was going to work on. Of those, one (<a href=\"https://svpow.com/papers-by-sv-powsketeers/taylor-and-wedel-2022-on-vertebral-orientation/\">What do we mean by “cranial” and “caudal” on a vertebra?, Taylor and Wedel 2022</a>) is complete; one (the superbaro project) has advanced but been interrupted by its three offspring papers; and the other six have pretty much not advanced at all (though I do still plan to do them all). Meanwhile, I have done a ton of work on projects that weren&#8217;t even on my radar back then, including <a href=\"https://svpow.com/papers-by-sv-powsketeers/taylor-and-wedel-2021-on-pneumatic-variation/\">pneumatic variation (Taylor and Wedel 2021)</a> and <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2022/01/28/case-study-the-conception-slooow-gestation-and-birth-of-the-incomplete-necks-paper/\">finally putting a stake through the heart</a> of <a href=\"https://svpow.com/papers-by-sv-powsketeers/taylor-2015-on-incomplete-necks/\">neck incompleteness (Taylor 2022)</a>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the bad moral. But there is also a good moral. This is a nice example of what Matt wrote about way back in 2011, for <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2011/02/03/tutorial-12-how-to-find-problems-to-work-on/\">Tutorial 12: How to find problems to work on</a>. Once you actually get started working on something — <em>anything</em> — it will tend to sprout buds. And those buds can easily — too easily, sometimes — become new projects of their own. There is no such thing as a linear programme of research, at least not in my experience. Just an endlessly ramifying tree of fascinating areas that beg to be worked on.</p>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Nieuwland, Ilja. 2019. <em>American dinosaur abroad: a cultural history of Carnegie&#8217;s plaster Diplodocus</em>.

This of course is how it should always be — it&#8217;s a bit stupid that I am drawing attention to this schedule like it&#8217;s something extraordinary, but the truth is that it <em>is</em> extraordinary. At any rate that makes it fifteen times faster than <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2022/01/28/case-study-the-conception-slooow-gestation-and-birth-of-the-incomplete-necks-paper/\">my long-delayed (mostly my fault) paper on neck incompleteness</a> (Taylor 2022).</p>\n<p>I got so deeply into this paper when I was lead-authoring it that the phrase &#8220;the Concrete <em>Diplodocus</em> of Vernal&#8221; really started to echo around in my head. That is why the paper ends by expressing this wish:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our dearest hope for this paper is that it inspires someone to create a Dungeons and Dragons module in which the Concrete <em>Diplodocus</em> of Vernal is a quest artifact with magical powers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But Mike, you ask — how did you, a scientist, find yourself writing a history paper?

If you want to read on after that, fine; but even if you stop there, you&#8217;ll still have read something fascinating, counter-intuitive, well referenced and (I think) pretty convincing.</p>\n<p>Anyway. The post that fascinates me right now is one of the digressions: &#8220;<a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet\">Interlude B: The Nutrient Sludge Diet</a>&#8220;. In this post, the author tells us about &#8220;a 1965 study in which volunteers received all their food from a &#8216;feeding machine&#8217; that pumped a &#8216;liquid formula diet&#8217; through a &#8216;dispensing syringe-type pump which delivers a predetermined volume of formula through the mouthpiece'&#8221;, but they were at liberty to choose how many hits of this neutral-tasting sludge they took.</p>\n<p>This study had an absolutely sensational outcome: among the participants with healthy body-weight, the amount of nutrient sludge that they chose to feed themselves was almost exactly equal in caloric content to their diets before the experiment. But the grossly obese participants (weighing about 400 lb = 180 kg), chose to feed themselves a tiny proportion of their usual intake — about one tenth — and lost an astonishing amount of weight. All without feeling hunger.</p>\n<p>Please do read <a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet\">the Slime Mold Time Mold write-up</a> for the details. But I will let you in right now on the study&#8217;s very very significant flaw. The sample-size was two. That is, two obese participants, plus a control-group of two healthy-weight individuals. And clearly whatever conclusion we can draw from a study of that size is merely anecdotal, having no statistical power worth mentioning.</p>\n<p>And now we come to the truly astonishing part of this. <strong>It seems no-one has tried to replicate this study with a decent-sized sample.</strong> The blog says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If this works, why hasn’t someone replicated it by now? It would be pretty easy to run a RCT where you fed more than five obese people nutrient sludge <em>ad libitum</em> for a couple weeks, so this means either it doesn’t work as described, or it does work and for some reason no one has tried it. Given how huge the rewards for this finding would be, we’re going to go with the “it doesn’t work” explanation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet/comment-page-1/#comment-15162\">a comment</a>, I asked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>OK, I’ll bite. Why <i>hasn’t</i> anyone tried to replicate the astounding and potentially valuable findings of these studies? It beggars belief that it’s not been tried, and multiple times. Do you think it <i>has</i> been tried, but the results weren’t published because they were unimpressive? That would be an appalling waste.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"comment-like-15162\" class=\"comment-likes comment-not-liked\">The blog author <a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet/comment-page-1/#comment-15164\">replied</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our guess is that it simple hasn’t been tried! Academia likes to pretend that research is one-and-done, and rarely checks things once they’re in the literature. We agree, someone should try to replicate!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m sort of at a loss for words here. How can it possibly be that, 58 years after a pilot study that potentially offers a silver bullet to the problem of obesity, no-one has bothered to check whether it works? I mean, the initial study is so old that <em>Revolver</em> hadn&#8217;t been released. Yet it seems to have just lain there, unloved, as the Beatles moved on through <em>Sergeant Pepper</em>, the White Album, <em>Abbey Road</em> et al., broke up, pursued their various solo projects, died (50% of the sample) and watched popular music devolve into whatever the heck it is now.</p>\n<p>Why aren&#8217;t obesity researchers all over this?</p>\n"},{"id":"http://svpow.com/?p=20657","title":"The ludicrous sizes of world-record individuals","link":"https://svpow.com/2023/02/06/the-ludicrous-sizes-of-world-record-individuals/","published":"Mon, 06 Feb 2023 08:59:20 +0000","description":"This recent news story tells of a cane toad found in Australia that weighs six pounds.

So this new world-record individual masses six times as much as a typical adult.</p>\n<p>Mature male saltwater crocodiles <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> are typically about 4.5 m long, but the world-record verified skull length is 76 cm long indicating a total length of about 7 m. Having a length 1.56 times that of a typical individual, this beast would have massed 1.56^3 = 3.75 times as much.</p>\n<p>There may be less variance in mammal sizes. The world-record elephant Satao massed about 11 tonnes. That&#8217;s about double the typical adult African elephant mass, which is various reported as 5 or 6 tonnes.</p>\n<p>Now think about sauropod sizes. We have a bunch of big <em>Diplodocus</em> specimens all measuring on the order of 25 m in length, and massing perhaps 15 tonnes. If world-record individuals compared to these as world-record elephants do, there would have been <em>Diplodocus</em> individuals of twice that mass (30 tonnes); if they compared as crocs do, we should expect giant specimens massing 3.75 times as much (56 tonnes); and if they compared as cane toads do, then the factor of 6 would give us giant <em>Diplodocus</em> individuals massing 90 tonnes.</p>\n<p>All of this is speculative of course — wildly so — because we have such tiny samples of <em>Diplodocus</em> compared with the three extant species discussed above. It&#8217;s not remotely surprising that the ten or so specimens we have don&#8217;t include a freak like this. But there&#8217;s a good chance they were out there.</p>\n<p>Oh, and for <em>Brachiosaurus</em>, of which known individuals massed perhaps 30 tonnes, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to imagine giant individuals massing 60, 112 or <em>gulp!</em> 180 tonnes. Yes, the imagination balks at the idea of a 180-tonne land animal: but that alone is not reason enough to discount the possibility.</p>\n"}]}
