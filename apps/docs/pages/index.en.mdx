# What is the Rogue Scholar?

The Rogue Scholar improves your science blog in important ways, including full-text search, long-term archiving, and DOIs and metadata.

### Full-Text Search

Most blogging platforms don't support full-text search (which requires a backend service such Elasticsearch),
and instead use tags to classify content. In addition, the search typically is local to the blog, and 
doesn't find related content on other blogs. The Rogue Scholar uses the [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/) software to provide
full-text search using the [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) (a fork of the Elasticsearch software) backend service.

### Long-Term Archiving

Blog content is typically not available long-term, in particular for blogs maintained by
individuals or time-limited projects. The InvenioRDM software powering the Rogue Scholar can provide
long-term archiving when backed by an organization such as a library that focusses on long-term archiving.

### DOIs and Metadata

DOIs and consistent metadata facilitate Full-Text Search and Long-Term Archiving. Metadata such
as language, subject area, title, abstract and author names support discovery. DOI registration helps
with URL changes as URLs not only change paths with platform changes (which can be resolved with redirection
on the host), but may also change hosts. A special use case is a blog that stopped publishing, and 
where the DOI can then transparently redirect to the Long-Term Archive. Using DOIs for scholar blogs
thus greatly enhances their discoverability and persistence, making it far easier for science blog posts
to become part of the scholarly record by citing them.
